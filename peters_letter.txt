	Greetings Inland Listers,

I would like hereby to nominate as an honorary enclave of the Inland 
Empire the nation of Sweden. While it lacks the obvious similarities of 
the likewise benighted cities of Omaha, Nebraska and Blacksburg, 
Virginia, I nevertheless feel quite confident as a nearly lifelong 
resident of the Empire in saying that a wealth of intangibles which 
cannot here be fully expressed easily compensates for this lack, and 
makes our recognition of Sweden in this regard not only justifiable but 
compulsory.

sincerely,
Peter Hughes
