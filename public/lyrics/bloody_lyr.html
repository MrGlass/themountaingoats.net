<a name="factory"><h2>Love Factory</h2></a>

At the love factory they manufacture love, that's what they do
They won't deny it if you ask them
The factory is run by very sexy people
The smell of sex hangs thickly in the air
At the love factory they manufacture love, that's what they do
And they do not take it lightly

The factory is closed only four days a year
Except in March of '92 they had a nine day shutdown
