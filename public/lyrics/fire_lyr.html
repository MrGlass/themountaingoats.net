hey don't touch the door.
because the door will surely kill you.
i hear you saying that you don't see what i mean,
well you better look again.

stop looking at the floor.
because the whole building's turning, and turning, and turning.
and don't touch the door.
can't you see the door's burning?

and all at once the street is filled with light.
and all at once the street is filled with sound.
when i hold you i know our number's being called somewhere.
let them come on down.

you were standing near the water, when the wind ripped through.
heard your throat open up like a champagne bottle
i heard the one perfect song pouring out of you,
there was a darkening sky reflected on the river.
there was no way of determining where we were

low hills, colors gone crazy,
you standing like a ghost with the water behind you.
it's hard to grab ahold of some things sometimes,
like you need me to remind you.

you were standing near the water.
and i was looking at the water.
then you went down in the water,
and the river began to boil.
there was a minute when i thought i knew what you were about,
and then you opened up your eyes and the lord came out

low hills, colors gone crazy,
you rising from the water like a bird,
you had a pure song possessing you from shoulder to hip
and i recognized every single word.

song for john davis</a>
</h3>
the day we set sail from england
the wind behind us was fair
the day we set sail from england
there were smiling faces everywhere
and the snow came down on new hampshire today
and the snow came down on new hampshire today

the day we put the grain into the ground
there were smiling faces all around
and underneath the trees we planted when we landed

when i was a child
i spoke with the language of a child
but when i became a man, i put away childish things
and the snow came down on new hampshire today
and the snow came down on new hampshire today

<h3>
<a name="stars">
stars around her</a>
</h3>
i saw the darkness coming down, 
it posed no threat to me
i let the dakrness ease its way around
it was every good thing 
i'd expected it would be
i saw you coming, 
through the twisting vines outside
i saw the new moon collide 
with the stars 
clustered around her.

i saw the young fruit, on the new lime
i felt your breath catch it's rhythm.
i heard your legs push away the tall dry brush
i saw the moon and the stars 
and knew the secrets within them.
i heard you saying 
my name into my ear
no one has to tell me 
why you've come here,
'cause i know.
i know.
i know.
