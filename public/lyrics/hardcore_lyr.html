lyrics file for hardcore acoustic
<pre>
<h3><a name="maine">
going to maine*</a>
</h3>

You and me are in a lot of trouble
And somebody's gonna burst our bubble
Your husband
My wife
My marriage
Your life

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine

Someone knows what's going on
Someone knows, and someone's gonna tell
Someone's gonna wrap us up in styrofoam and paper
And mail us flat-rate right down to Hell

Repeat Chorus twice, drink heavily for 6 months, repeat Chorus again
