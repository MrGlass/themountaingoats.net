<h3><a name="resplendent">michael myers resplendent</a></h3>
1, 2, 3, 4

I am ready for my close-up today.
too long I've let my self-respect stand in my way.
well the prom queen's caught in the high beams
and the string's keen it's a big scene.

but when the house goes up in flames
no one emerges triumphantly from it.
when the scum begins to circle the drain
well, everybody loves a winner.

I spent eight hours in my makeup chair,
waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair.
well the fire's bright and the frame's tight.
try to get right while we've still got light
but when the house goes up in flames
no one emerges triumphantly from it.
when the scum begins to circle the drain
well, everybody loves a winner.

yeah, and the house goes up in flames
no one emerges triumphantly from it.
when the scum begins to circle the drain
everybody's gotta love a winner.



<h3><a name="earth">Last Man on Earth</a> </h3>
1, 2, 3, 4

just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers
hoisting my body up atop the charred debris.
who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes?
don't even question your senses.
you can be sure that's me.
when all the pretenders to your hand lie dead across the land,
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
crawling around, down on the ground.

when the hail mary's you've been saying lose their savor,
just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in,
whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you
just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim?
it was their love you wanted, not mine.
but when they deny your name three times
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
crawling around, down on the ground.

and I will throw you across my shoulders.
and I will bleed and I will drool.
and the cameras will slow pan across my face.
and I will try to say something cool.

just as the hoardes of thirsting demons close around us,
raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun,
who will that guy be holding you so high above them?
you know and I know.
everyone knows it.
I'm the one.
I may have failed you once before,
but this right here, this means war.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
I'll be the last man on earth.
crawling around, down on the ground.



<h3><a name="toolshed"> Toolshed</a> </h3>
out by the tracks where the sunflowers grow high and fine,
three sets of tracks: steve and rochelle's and the last one's mine.
guy with a hat down in the weeds in a carboard box
secrets to keep. 
records to seal up.
kittens weighed down with rocks.
there was a little toolshed where he made us suffer.

back at the school everyone looks like the ememy.
and we couldn't sleep and i had the voices inside of me.
steve and rochelle and me down the well all semester long.
back to the tracks to try and make peace, 
but the box was gone, was gone.
there was a little toolshed where the sad man made us suffer.
