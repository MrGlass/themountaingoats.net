<h3><a name="hotel">hotel road</a></h3>
thirty story hotel overlooking the sea
friends on either arm supporting me
it's hard to walk now
but i will go down somehow
i'm going down the old road
i'm going down the old road

children kick a soccer ball around in the street
kalpadruma trees are melting in the heat
it's hard to walk here
where the waves shine so clear
i'm going down the old road
i'm going down down the old road

above the swollen ocean the burning yellow sun
hits the hotel's mylar windoows catching every one
it's hard to say why
i should come here to die.
i'm going down the old road.
i'm going down the old road.

<h3><a name="waves">bad waves</a></h3>
beachfront hotel, twenty dollars a night
nineteen seventy-two, sun yellow and bright
too exhausted to think or to talk
young boys from bangledesh breakdancing on the sidewalk
and the waves will tear them all to pieces
the waves will tear them all to pieces.

twinkling waterford crystal in the banquet hall
childlike religious paintings lining the wall
i will try to gather my strength
and i will rest up all week
all i can say to them now 
when i open my mouth to speak
is that the waves will tear us all to pieces
the waves will tear us all to pieces.

<h3><a name="transjordanian">transjordanian blues</a></h3>
this church is rotten from the top down.
this church is rotten from the top down.
but i, i am going to clean house tonight.
and it's going to go back into the earth it rose from.

these walls can't keep the world at bay.
no, these walls can't keep the world at bay.
our time, our time is limited and precious.
but this place, this place is limitless and pernicious.

would you all just follow me out into the open?
leave your coats and handbags, damn it all.
can't you see the floors are smoking?

this church is not long for this world.
this church is not long for this world.
and if you're wondering who to blame,
i want to praise his name with songs and feasting.
follow me to the open field
where the truth will be revealed if you're really listening.

hosannah, hosannah, i am saved by the blood of the lamb.
one day when i was lost, he died on that cross,
and i am saved by the blood of the lamb.

<h3><a name="tongue">burned my tongue</a></h3>
woke up this morning about a quarter to five
said the prayer you'd taught me to keep myself alive,
it burned my tongue.
it burned my tongue.

fried some grains in butter, 
said a simple grace,
sat down at the table,
fed my greedy face.
it burned my tongue.
it burned my tongue.

looked out at the ocean
i could see it so clear.
said the only name
i can ever stand to hear.
it burned my tongue
it burned my tongue.

when i ask you to sing with me
i wish you'd sing along.
thirty years in this world -- 
thirty years too long.
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.

you tooks away my friends.
you took my will to live.
i gave you all i got.
what more have i got to give?
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.
it burns my tongue.

<h3><a name="cylinder">world cylinder</a></h3>
dont like going to the doctor.
i don't like looking at the mirror.
i like looking out the window,
watching the waves break.
do i have to hit you over the head with it?
do i have to hit you over the head with it?

tired of talking to the suckers,
i'm tired of talking to the wealthy.
i want to talk to men and women
who haven't got anything left.
do i have to hit you over the head with it?
do i have to hit you over the head with it?

carry me down to the water
where i used to play when i was five.
let me go, let me go down to the water.
don't bring me back alive.
do i have to hit you over the head with it?
do i have to hit you over the head with it?
