<h3><a name="10freeway">
short song about the 10 freeway</a>
</h3>
evening came on like a big red wing
and the dying sun, split his colors on everything,
and as the night came on, you burst into song
and you scraped your car up against the guardrail
and god is present in the sweeping gesture
but the devil is in the details

<h3>

No, I Can't.</a>

1, 2, 3, 4

you bought me some chocolates.
and you bought me a rose.
and you brought me a paper bag.
and you brought me a lamp.

thank you for the chocolates.
thank you for the rose.
thank you for the paperbag.
thank you for the lamp.

(now i have everything i need.) x4

you brought me a sofa.
and you brought me some books.
and you brought me a filing cabinet.
and you brought me a panasonic dx4500.

thank you for the sofa.
thank you for the books.
thanks for the filing cabinet.
i don't know what i..
i don't know what i.. ever did without it.

(now i have everything i need.) x4

you came by. and you came in.
and you let the wind in.
it must be cold outside.
we stared out, through the sliding glass door.
but i'd forgotten what we were looking for.

thank you for coming by.
it's nice to see you once in a while.
thanks for the coat i forgot to mention.
i've been freezing in here.
i've been freezing in here.

(now i have everything i need.) x4
yeah!

<a name="plato">
song for dana plato</a>
</h3>
the 3 month ride sticks in your mind
as though the insides of your head were a big screen.
and coming in on a evening wind.
it's the unmistakable scent of brilliantine.
what kind of memory serves, what kind of world is it,
that comes headlong at you, then swerves at the last possible second?
it's this one. it's this one.

and it's easy to slow down.
and it's easy to slow down.
and it's easy to just lie out by the blue pools
in the squinting sun and slow down.
and it's easy to slow down.

and in situations like these, it's sometimes useful to
think of life as one long continuous evening
that never turns into night.
hey hey!

<h3>
<a name="sign">
the sign</a>
</h3>
[john spoken] i never get tired of this one...

i've got a new life
you would hardly recognize me.
i'm so glad.
how could a person like me care for you?
why should i bother when you're not the one?

i saw the sign
and it opened up my eyes i saw the sign.
love is demanding without understanding
yeah i saw the sign and it opened up my eyes i saw the sign
and noone's gonna drag you up.

under the pale moon,
for so many years i've wondered who you are.
how could a person like you bring me joy?
under the pale moon where i see a lot of stars.

i saw the sign
and it opened up my eyes i saw the sign.
love is demanding without understanding
yeah i saw the sign and it opened up my eyes i saw the sign
and noone's gonna drag you up
to get into the light where you belong.

i saw the sign
and it opened up my eyes i saw the sign.
love is demanding without understanding
yeah i saw the sign and it opened up my eyes i saw the sign
and noone's gonna drag you up
hey!
