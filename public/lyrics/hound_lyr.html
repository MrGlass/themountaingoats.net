<h3><a name="garden"> 
the garden song 
</a></h3> 

I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom. 
I see the flags are flying high. 
I hear you've gone and rearranged things in your room. 
I guess you're trying to cut-off my air supply. 

I came toward your window, real slowly. 
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil. 
I guess by the now the flowers in your garden know me. 
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil. 

my bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt, 
moving up my ankles, but I don't fear you. 
the thorns began tearing at my shirt, 
but I didn't even care when they tore clear through. 

your garden can't hurt me. 
your flowers don't threaten my life. 
your garden can't hurt me anymore. 
your flowers don't threaten my life. 


<h3><a name="wisconsin"> 
going to wisconsin 
</a></h3> 

there was the sound of a lake boiling over 
on that day. 
everyone said just to sit still, 
but the thickening air got in my way. 

so the hooks been baited now, 
yeah, the cheese is on the water. 
yeah, all the water's been cleansed of all impurities, 
but now it really doesn't matter. 
let's go! let's go! 

wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
yeah, wisconsin bound. 

the bottom of the boat was a hot-plate come alive. 
but the boat wasn't real, and this is how I feel: 
you don't know where you are, until you arrive. 
and the frogs sang out from the distant banks. 
and you say you need me in california, 
but, no thanks! 

wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
wisconsin bound. 
yeah, wisconsin bound. 

let's go! 


<h3><a name="spilling"> 
spilling toward alpha 
</a></h3> 

I hear you moving in the hallway. 
I hear you sharpening your claws. 
I hear you polishing your teeth, sometimes. 
but I don't mind. 

and I hear you out in the garage. 
I hear you messing with the motor. 
I hear you tinker with the engine, sometimes. 
but I don't mind. 

and I hear you moving in the kitchen! 
I hear you in there late at night. 
I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes. 
but I don't mind. 


<h3><a name="negative"> 
alpha negative 
</a></h3> 

the house was pretty and the yard was wide 
and I felt strong, with you at my side. 
your eyes at night, had a beautiful glowing in them. 
and I knew in my heart, just what was growing in them. 

ah, but you made me drink poison. 
it felt smooth running down my throat. 
I love you. and you made me drink poison. 
it was cool and smooth and sweet. 
do you remember... 

we had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard, 
and I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time. 
I tried to stop the thing matastasizing in us, 
but in the warm, slow evening, 
I could feel it rising in us. 

ah, and you made me drink poison. 
it felt so smooth, sliding down my throat. 
I love you so much. and you made me drink poison. 
it was cool and smooth and sweet and cool 
and smooth and sweet and cool and smooth. 


<h3><a name="torch"> 
the torch song 
</a></h3> 

[spoken:] we'll just try that again. 

the sun was coming up, and our friend was sound asleep. 
but we saw through the window, that the water ran so deep, 
that you couldn't make out, the ocean floor, 
then I saw you in the light. I couldn't take it any more. 

give me your hand. 
give me everything you've got. 
and the light from window will fall on us burning hot, 
just like a torch. 

the air was humid; I will not forget. 
when we stepped outside, I hear your footsteps. 
now in my mind, it's a soft sound, 
almost imperceptible, against the giving ground. 

let me kiss your eyelids with my lips. 
let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips, 
just like a torch.

I love the cows.

[this song (whose titles is just "--") seems to be just 
some random guitar chords whose speed has been changed 
after recording, perhaps by varying the speed of a record. --j.m.]

<h3><a name="bitter4"> 
standard bitter love song #4 
</a></h3> 

well I see you've left me a photograph 
of a leopard tearing an antelope in half. 
what have you done? what have you done? 
what have you done...with our love? 
what have you done? 

well I see you've resorted to petty theft. 
you try to take something from me, 
but there's nothing left. 
what have you done? what have you done? 
what have done...with our love? 
where have you put it? 

well I hear you calling from way over there 
and I can't find it anywhere. 
what have you done? what have you done? 
what have you done...with our love? 
what have you done? 


<h3><a name="mexico"> 
going to mexico 
</a></h3> 

I saw you at your window. 
I saw you in the sun. 
I saw you in the window, looking out. 

I reached my hand in there, 
then I touched your hair 
and felt myself burn, in the morning. 

and the chickens were screaming. 
black dog at my heels. 
and the bluejays were coughing up in the trees. 

I'd forgotten my name. 
I felt kind of ashamed, 
and felt myself burn, in the morning. 

I saw you at your window, 
at the beginning of summer! 
and invisible stars, sent their heat down! 

I imagined your touch, 
it was almost too much! 
burned like a bonfire in the morning. 


<h3><a name="blues"> 
lab rat blues 
</a></h3> 

I saw you. I saw your hair. 
I could spend the rest of my life in there. 

I saw you, and I sank into your eyes. 
I'm not going to apologize. 

because you, with your own hands, 
made the whole world. 
you can't fool me. 
I'm on to you now. 

because you, with your own hands, 
created everything. 
you can't fool me.
I'm on to you now. 

yeah, I saw you, but you saw me first, 
living water to quench my thirst. 
and you tell me quiet down, 
but I have no doubt. 
I know what you're all about, 

because you, with your own hands 
made the whole world. 
you can't fool me. 
I'm on to you now. 

because you, with your own hands, 
created everything. 
you can't fool me any more. 
I'm on to you now. 


<h3><a name="kansas"> 
going to kansas 
</a></h3> 

you were all were dressed in green! 
clouds bounced against the edges of the sky. 
you had the prettiest hair I'd ever seen. 
we saw the world passing by. 

there was an ocean's droning, 
though we were nowhere near the shore. 
we heard each other giggling and moaning, 
then we couldn't hear each other any more. yeah. 

when my head was resting on your breast bone, 
I could hear your beating heart. 
24 hours later, you had left me completely alone. 
I heard the whole world come apart. 

and you were all dressed in green! 
rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star. 
you know, you know what I mean. 
yeah I remember who you are. 


<h3><a name="water"> 
the water song 
</a></h3> 

water came springing out the side of the wall, 
and I guess the same thing will happen to us all. 
we don't know how to explain what I mean, 
I mean to say it's kind of hard to explain. now, 

let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 

water came down through the cracks in the ceiling, 
but this time the water had a different feeling. 
it's the sort of feeling that is hard to explain, 
so, let me put it to you in a different way. now, 

let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 

you're the salesman. I'm the buyer. 
you're the tractor. I am the tire. 
I'm the glass. you're the water that fills me. 
I hear them coming. now, 

let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. now, 

let them kill me. yeah! 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 
let them kill me. 


<h3><a name="spain"> 
going to spain 
</a></h3> 

it's heaven up here, 
but it's heaven down there! 
and you're gonna leave me. 
now I don't care. 

it's heaven outside, 
but it's heaven indoors. 
well, go on and leave me. 
I don't care any more. 

I hear the airplane coming! 
I hear the airplane coming! 
I hear the airplane coming, now, 
it can't touch me. 

I see you going up the little stair. 
go on and board the plane, 
I don't care. I, 

I see you hold his hand. 
I see you wave good-bye. 
I don't know you anymore, 
so I'm not going to cry, now, 

I see the airplane coming! 
I feel the airplane coming! 
I hear the airplane coming, now, 
it can't touch me. 

<h3><a name="mind"> 
keep it on your mind* 
</a></h3> 

[spoken:] it's a quarter till 2 on the 23rd of february 
and this is a hank williams song. 

now if you stay out, 
and start playing around, 
your baby's gonna burn your playhouse down, 
you better keep it on your mind. 
you better keep it on your mind. 
you'll be a-moanin' and a-groanin'! 
lord, you better keep it on your mind. 

now wrong is wrong, 
and right is right. 
if you make a pig mad, 
he's sure gonna bite. 
you better keep it on your mind. 
you better keep it on your mind. 
I've had it proven to me. 
lord, you better keep it on your mind. 

every fuss got the same old end, 
I don't believe the good lord 
meant for a man to win. 
you better keep it on your mind. 
you better keep it on your mind. 
you'll be a-groanin' and a-hoppin'! 
lord, you better keep it on your mind. 

now if she gets mad, 
and tells you goodbye. 
there's not a thing that you can do, 
but sit at home and cry. 
you better keep it on your mind. 
you better keep it on your mind. 
you better call her sweet mamma! 
lord, you better keep it on your mind.
