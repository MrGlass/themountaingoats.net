<h3><a name="portwashington">
going to port washington</a>
</h3>
the trees were all decked out in their best fall colors
there was a snap in the air
when you eased down the window
and the new york sun brought out the highlights in your hair
and gently, gently
the constellations aligned
and as we crossed over the throgs neck bridge i had
something on my mind

when we rolled down the street
in the cool of the morning
i could feel the new day dawn
and somebody had gone and turned the waterworks on
and slowly, surely
i saw the whole story unwind
i had never loved anyone like i loved you
and i had something on my mind

<h3>
if these are wrong, or you know guitar chords, or just want to say hi,
