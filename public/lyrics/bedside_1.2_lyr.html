<pre>
<h3><a name="soft">
soft targets</a>
</h3>
you cry when you get drunk
and i can't find the right things to say.
sooner or later you'll start breaking plates
and i'll do what i can to stay out of your way.

there is nobody innocent here.
i got more blood on my hands than you do.
its you and its me and the baby makes three.
yeah but we've got our love to carry us through.
we've got our love to carry us through.

i cry when i'm hungry
something is wrong with my brain.
and the ghost of our future's awake in the attic.
he moans and he wails as he rattles his chain. 

we embrace on the floor in the kitchen,
emissaries  from neighboring lands
when i hunt down the vampire that did this to us,
i will rip out his heart with my hands.
i will rip out his heart with my hands.
