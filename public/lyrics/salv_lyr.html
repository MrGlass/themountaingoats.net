<h2><a name="omega">alpha omega -the mountain goats</a></h2>

on the morning you went away
the air was humid and the sky was gray

i had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia

the air was wet, my face was wetter
the pink flowers along the western window made me feel better
i turned the air conditioner on
found the note on scented stationary - you were long gone

i had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia

i popped the top off of the aluminum can
let the brine slide down my fingers, man
it was warm, it was warm on my skin
but i felt the cold blast looming on in

i had boiled peanuts for breakfast from cairo, georgia

<a name="handball"><h2>hand ball -the mountain goats</h2></a>

i am the dry meat that fills the mouth
i am the fire that burns without wood
i am evil forest, kill a man on the day that his life seems sweetest to him

i did not come to play hand ball
i did not come to play hand ball
