lyrics file for full force galesburg

<h3><a name="weekend">
weekend in western illinois</a></h3>
the land's opening up like a blanket,
and the dandelions spread themselves thickly out
along the fields, which are, evidently, endless;
and we are hotly in love with one another.
we've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats.
we are, for some reason, all the time, bleeding,
and we are friendless.

but we love these dogs that roll on the lawns here in galesburg --
because they seem to know something nobody else knows.
it is written on the smiles on their faces,
and it rings in their high young voices
and we are burning up all of our choices up here
where the tall grass grows, up here in galesburg.

the sky's opening up like an old wound,
and the rain on our bodies is warm tonight
and the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder.
and we can taste fresh blood in our mouths again:
there is no chance of getting enough of it,
and we tally up all our possessions, and we're going under.

but we love these dogs that loll in the rain here in galesburg
as the new season rocks them in its terrible arms.
yeah they howl as though the world were ending,
and we are watching the sky unwinding
and some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form
up here in galesburg.



<h3><a name="usmill">
us mill</a></h3>
way up north
down the road a little
back in new england
right here in the middle
and all the way out west
we had our ears to the ground
all of our dreams resting in the same spot
listening for the old sound
and it was ringing as clear as crystal
it was shining as bright as gold
grain gathering on the stone floor
and we were ?spring-heeled? and we were real cold
all summer long
deep into autumn
in a high room
and down here in the bottom
down here in the bottom



<h3><a name="julian">
song for the julian calandar</a></h3>
sun twinkling on the river this evening
i tasted chocolate on my tongue
darkness climbing up the ladder to the sky
rung by agonizing rung
i heard firecrackers next door
i wondered what it is i bargained for
when i lay quiet on the floor and you were knocking

let me be your witness
let me walk out on the edge
the sun refused to shine on my backyard today
darkness climbing up the house
coming through the window ledge
i saw the fircrackers bursting on the sidewalk
i heard you talking your baby talk
i saw the bright lights again and
i felt the shock ?where you were not?



<h3><a name="maize">
maize stalk drinking blood</a></h3>
lying in the hot sun today
watch as the clouds run away
thought a little while about you
the sky was a petrifying blue
and while the ggeese flew past
for no reason at all
i let the sky fall
this is an empty country, and i am the king
and i should not be allowed to touch anything

i picked myself up off the ground
shook the gras from my hair and i
walked around
welcome warm sunlight in my eye
strangers passing by
i shimmied up the black walnut tree
let the hard blue sky fall right through me
and i saw the sad young cardinals, trying to sing
and i should not be allowed to touch anything



<h3><a name="stalingrad">
evening in stalingrad</a></h3>
when you were nineteen i first laid eyes on you
the small stream that ran through the center of the town
carried your name to me
your hair was dark and your eyes were a frosty blue
and then they put me in jail 'til you were twenty-three

when you were twenty-four we took to drinking and dancing
we boxed with our shadows like a couple of kangaroos
and then we went down to ?chechnia? for the weekend
your eyes were glacial and your promises all rang true
and things are happening here while we sleep
i can feel it in my boiling brain
and i am dreaming you ??????????????
when i see the stalingrad ?car driving through the night rain?

they'll have to carry me out on my back
they'll have to tear me to pieces alright
we are warm in our ?????????? week down here
we've got stars in our eyes tonight



<h3><a name="minnesota">
minnesota</a></h3>
seeds came in the mail from holland
and the language on the package is wonderful and strange
all sorts of flowers that grow up from the earth
and goodly colors gloriously arranged
i circled the house and i scattered them around
let the water ink down into the soil
stared a long time at the residue
blood, milk and oil
god the humidity is something
our shirts are soaked clean through
the house is throbbing and the heat keeps coming
and i keep looking at you

and then you're singing in dutch to me
and i recognize the song
it seems so old and so fragile 
and i haven't heard it in so long
we may throw the windows open later
we are not as far west as you uppose we are
hot wind coming off the water
the sky gone crazy with stars
while we stay here we imagine we're alive
we see shadows on the walls
there's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air
blod, water and alcohol
jut the old blood
rising up through the wooden floor again
just the old love
asking for more again



<h3><a name="original">
original air-blue gown</a></h3>
rain all burned away
the horseflies are an irridecent green
plums boiled down to pulp
drying on a screen

bright red air inside the house here
i can barely draw breath
dark blue shapes popped behind my eyelids
i am not afriad of death

and on the television
black and white footage of the young casius clay
my god, my god, my god
he was something

fists flashing as he comes toward the screen
sailing headlong into nothing
and disappearing
reappearing
out there in the clearing
floating down the slight breeze
that plays along the edge of the leaves
it's you.
it's you.
it's you.



<h3><a name="brownsville">
it's all here in brownsville</a></h3>
meanwhile out where nothing starts
out where the railyard ends
the sun above is trying to kill himself
we were watching the skies again

why do we come down to brownsville
year after year after year
the was the question we never ever posed
ringing like a siren in our ears

down on the mexican border
in the unfathomable heat
with our shirts tied around our waists
and the world at our feet

we looked at one another's bodies
figured we looked alright
ready to die if we had to
watching the skies all night

and i was sure my heart would break
when the sun sank down into california
i felt your breath on my neck, it was hot and wet and pure
and i wanted to warn you

and it's all coming apart again
it's all coming apart again
it's all coming apart again
it's all coming apart again
