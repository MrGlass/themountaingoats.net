<a name="mess"><h3>the mess inside</h3></a>
we took a weekend, drove to provo.
the snow was white and fluffy.
but a weekend in utah won't fix what's wrong with us.
the gray sky was cold and real cryptic above me.
i wanted you to love me like you used to do.

we took two weeks in the bahamas.
went out dancing every night.
tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temple things.
most of the time i guess i felt alright.
i wanted you to love me like you used to do.

but you cannot run.
and you cannot hide.
from the wreck we've made of our house
and the mess inside.

we went down to new orleans
one weekend in the spring.
tried real hard to find the thing we'd lost.
broke our backs trying.
couldn't find a single thing.
i wanted you to love me like you used to do.

we went to new york city in spetember.
took the train out of manhattan to the grand army stop.
found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago
where i felt such love for you i swore my heart was gonna pop.
i wanted you to love me like you used to do.

but i cannot run.
and i can't hide.
from the wreck we've made of our house.
from the mess inside.
hey!

where the dry dust turns the sunset pale.
where all summer long we saw ?? and faced her.
where we pulled water from a well by hand.
half a world away from the old promised land.
where you stand we've been given
a new covenant -- a real sharp one.
and we spend all our days and nights
gaining new appreciation of its finer points.
and waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves.
waiting for jesus to come along and save us. and we are
biding our time.
biding our time.
biding our time as best we know how.

where the texas doughboys used to play
before the wind blew everything away.
where we came to get away from our friends.
where we'd tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end.
we know our jokes are funny,
but in all the wrong ways and for all the wrong reasons.
and we watch old george o'mera movies
and relish the short time left.
yeah, waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves.
waiting for jesus to come along and save us. yes, and
biding our time.
biding our time.
biding our time as best we know how.


<a name="60nomore"><h3> sure do love you baby, but i can't do 60 no more </h3></a>
they moved down here and you came down too
where the surf's always wild and the skies are blue.
got my blood pressure measured down in pajo key.
one sixty-five over one twenty-three.
and the lights are low over pompano beach tonight.
and one light is flickering out for the last time.

coconuts growing in the coconut tree,
surf and turf and sand and sea.
down here in the wreckage, just us three,
him and you.
you and me.
and the lights are low over pompano beach tonight.
and one light is flickering out,
out for the last time.



<a name="santacruz"><h3> somebody else's parking lot in santa cruz </h3></a>
outside the opera house in sydney,
i saw my life come crashing to its end.
i cried out to the scale-tipper
on whom all living things depend.
strings of giseppe verde suffuse the evening air.
i wished, i wished, i wished that god would kill me,
instead of leaving me alone to see you standing there
before me. that sad look on your face.
you took me to so many places i never thought i'd go.
this is the worst place.

yeah we did our manners proud
on the night we said goodbye.
no big scene out there on the sidewalk,
as we pinpointed the place where all good things go to die.
i know you hate it when i get my headaches.
well, i've got a real prize tonight.
listening to ????,
it's not going to be alright.
and i'd like to think that this will pass, this will pass.
i know it's not the case.
of all the highs and lows and middle-ends you brought me to,
this is the worst place.



<a name="jam"></h3> jam eater blues </h3></a>
life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar.
life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar.
and life is too short to wait around for you to come home tonight.
life is too short, 
too short to do that.

life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long.
life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long.
i'm gonna lock 'em up tight and eat jam out of the jar all night.
'cause life is too short to make toast, 
or use spoons or napkins.

life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in tampa.
life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in tampa.
yeah, life is too short to let it go to waste like this,
but you never tasted jam before that tastes like this.
life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar,
god damn it.



<a name="saigon"><h3> saigon: song for anonymity </h3></a>
the last vestiges of the empire were crumbling.
daisies were pushing through the ground.
and i saw a crane disappear beneath still water
on the day when you came back around.
and though time remembers meaningless gestures.
your goodness will not be forgotten while i am still alive.
it was the eighteenth day of may in 1975.

and i asked if we could last a week or two.
and you said you thought we could.
and you came inside to leave the light trickling behind you.
and it was fine and it was good.
and so gleams the single moment before we heard the officers arrive.
on the eighteenth day of may in 1975.
hey.



<a name="yoga"><h3> yoga </h3></a>
we had our passports out and the kits to fix 'em up with.
and the hurricane lamp cast our shadows on the ceiling.
i watched 'em box with one another like punch and judy.
it was dangerous and delightful.
it was that kind of feeling
when you said you were sure there was nothing standing in our way.
and the lie ran off and hid itself in the alleys all around bombay.

i saw you knock the lamp over while reaching for the scissors
and i wondered how we'd ever get by without it.
and you fell into my arms, sweet and gentle.
poison in the water.
little doubt about it.
and you said that one of us would be all alone someday.
and the truth of it echoed inexhaustably all across bombay.
la la la.



<a name="kirby"><h3> going to kirby sigston </h3></a>
we boarded up the windows.
and we sealed the door shut.
and we let the special chicken build a nest right by the window.
your face was glowing.
the heat was strong.
we ate cold black eggs all day long
in the winter when the wind kicked up.

i saw your body moving through the incandescent light.
you were dancing by yourself there.
your sweater hugged your shoulders and it was alright.
we plucked sugar crystals from the cold english air.
i had a present for ya hidden down there
in the winter when the wind kicked up.



<a name="union"><h3> there is power in a union </h3></a>
<h6> originally: lyrics: billy brag music: traditional</h6>
there is a power in a factory.
there is power in the land.
there is power in the hand of the worker.
but it all amounts to nothing if together we don't stand.
yeah, there is power in a union.

the union forever!
defending our rights!
down with the blackleg!
all workers unite!
with our brothers and our sisters from many far-off lands,
yeah, there is power in a union!

now i long for the morning when they realize
brutality and unjust laws cannot defeat us.
but who'll defend the wokrers who cannot organize,
when the bosses send their lackeys out to cheat us?

yeah, money speaks for money!
the devil for his own!
who stands to speak for the skin and the bone?
what a comfort to the widow, a light to the child,
yeah, there is power in a union!

<a name="poltergeist"><h3> poltergeist </h3></a>
i can't stand it when you tell our infant son
that he was born beneath a bad sign.
and i can't stand it when smiles up at you
just because you're his mother.
and i can't stand the bitter thing that i've become
beneath the four walls that hold up our ceiling.
and i wonder when the house gets real quiet
who between us will be the first one to give into the feeling.
and i know you don't want me to hurt you tonight.
and i, i don't want you to hurt me the way you do.

i can't stand it when you put the boy to bed and ya
sing him those songs i used to sing to you.
yeah i can't stand to hear you sing those songs
when you know you don't mean them.
and i can't stand the way my body still remembers 
how much we used to mean to one another way back when.
and i can't stand going back to seek the shelter of your arms.
and then i can't stand it again.
and i know you don't want me to hurt you tonight.
and i, i don't want you to hurt me the way you do.


<a name="maris"><h3> song for roger maris </h3></a>
when the power of god shows up in your swing,
and the people start to notice and you can't do anything about it
and they all come out to see you. 
they start to crowd around.
let me tell ya brother, you can feel it coming down.
and i got an angel watching over me,
a monkey on my back,
the devil at my heels,
reporters breathing down my neck.

yeah my daddy always to me to finish what ya start.
my wife's about to leave me and it's going to break my heart.
and i no longer have my youth.
i no longer have my looks.
i got a god damned one-way ticket to the god damned history books.
and i got an angel watching over me,
a monkey on my back,
the devil at my heels,
reporters breathing down my neck.
hey, hey.



<a name="0275"><h3> 02-75 </h3></a>
i got your letter.
and i read what it said.
and i blushed with recognition at every word you said.
and you are my best friend.
and i have always known you.

i came to your house.
and i looked around.
and i felt the real rain falling down.
and you are my best friend.
and i have always known you.



<a name="pirates"><h3>pirates (so long lonely avenue)</h3></a>
<h6>this song by ricky lee jones</h6>
come on - joey get out of school
we got places to go
a '67 lincoln you got a radio that hurts
and the girls like to touch it
just to find out if it works
It wasn't me
don't look at me

joey live on the edge of the corner
of living on the run
i like to ride in the middle
i'm just tryin to have some fun
until the pirates come
until the pirates come to take me

and i won't need a pilot
got a pirate who might sail
somewhere far away i heard
you answer me
so i'm holding on
to your rainbow sleeves

well, goodbye boys,
oh my buddy boys,
oh my sad-eyed sinatras
it's a cold globe around the sea
you can keep the coat that I bought ya
and i know you'll get the chance to make it
and nothin's gonna stop you
you just reach right out and take it
and you'll say - so long, lonely avenue
yeah you'll say so long lonely avenue



<a name="things"><h3>my favorite things</h3></a>
champagne bubbled up through the nick of the bottle,
and sweet silence came out through the radio.
it was john coltrane.
god damn it, i love john coltrane!

you danced across the living room floor, 
and you kissed me once and then you kissed me some more.
you had your arms wrapped around my neck and it felt real fine,
and then your ankle knocked up against mine.
and resonating in my bones
was the precise crisp drumming of mr. elvin jones.
god damn it, i love john coltrane!



<a name="agemos"><h3>agemo's hoops</h3></a>
you were breathing against my throat
covering your laugh up with your long black overcoat
all circles warming up.
and you told me what you were going to do.
and i promised to do the same thing too.
and the air, the air in new england was pure
poison.

the car was parked out back among the trees.
your voice was getting higher by slow degrees.
you were giving me directions.
and you told me where i came from.
well, god bless us everyone.
and the air, the air in new england was pure
poison.
poison.
poison.
poison.



<a name="moon"><h3>the moon song</h3></a>
the moon shining, 
three hours is the best part of the day and
i want to tell you that you're so pretty and 
the words come out wrong and the rain ?? them away.
dead quiet you looked at me like you were looking into space.
yeah, in space noone could hear you say good bye.
without your ??? on your face.
that's not normal.
that's not right.
that's not very nice.
no it isn't.

the moon shining down on your body.
you look so nice.
and i want to tell you, but you don't want to hear it,
and i know. you don't have to tell me twice.
once would be civil. the moon shining.
i got it in my brain, and i had so much to say but there was dead quiet.
you were silent. three hours -- it's the best part of the day.
that's not normal.
that's not right.
that's not very nice.
no it isn't.

that's not normal.
that's not right.
that's not very nice.
no it isn't.



<a name="trash"><h3>trash</h3></a>
<h6>this is a suede song</h6>
maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear,
our tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair,
maybe it's our kookiness.
or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns,
our nothing places and our cellophane sounds,
maybe it's our looseness.

but we're trash, you and me.
we're the litter on the breeze.
we're the people on the streets.
we're trash, me and you.
it's in everything we do.
it's in everything we do.

maybe, maybe it's the things we say,
the places we go and the music we play,
maybe it's our cheapness.
or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had,
the lazy days and the crazes and the fads,
maybe it's our sweetness.
but we're trash, you and me.
we're the litter on the breeze.
we're the people on the street.
we're trash, me and you.
it's in everything we do.
it's in everything we do.



<a name="bridlington"><h3>going to bridlington</h3></a>
stopped by for the coffee and cake that you promised.
saw your porch light on.
saw your wire-haired terrier lazing on the lawn.
came right in through the front door.
went right down the main hall.
turned right into the kitchen.
there you were alright.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
and you had blood all over your hands.
someone was singing in the yard next door.
and you had blood all over your hands.

sat down on the kitchen floor.
looked up at you.
saw you smoothing down your skirt around your thighs.
wondered what good that was supposed to do.
and i saw you pull your hair back.
saw you messing with your earrings.
saw you trying to smile.
hey! you don't have to smile for me.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
and you had blood all over your hands.
something was cracking in the rafters of our house. 
and you had blood all over your hands.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
the moon was rising over bridlington.
the moon was rising.



<a name="wishing"><h3>wishing the house would crash</h3></a>
i was standing outside with my hands in the air.
and the scent of gardenias was everywhere.
let the house come down on me.

i made my invocation with my eyes on fire.
you were there at the window.
you are a god damned liar.
let the house come down on me.
let the house come down on you.



<a name="shoreline"><h3>song from the shoreline</h3></a>
through the bodies of a hundred people, i saw you.
i saw you coming through the crush.
saw you pushing through.

and in the bodies of a hundred people moving around,
i shut my ears off to the world, 
i couldn't hear a sound.
in the bodies of a hundred people, i saw you.
i saw you coming through the crush.
i saw you pushing through.

<a name="letter"><h3>letter from a motel</h3></a>
the beams we used to build our house are breaking at last.
the building will not hold together very much longer.
my arms are young, and they can do the work if called upon to do so.
but the house itself has weakened and it's tilting on its axis.

in the picture that you sent, i could see the windows getting soft.
and i could see the heat had gotten straight out of hand.
and i knew that none of this is what you'd been meaning to send along.
i did not mean to say what i'm saying now if we're gonna talk about what intentions were.
but the house itself is weak, very weak,
though you and our three daughters believe in what you want to believe.
from where i stand stability is everything.
in the room i'm standing in stability is everything.
and in this world, in this world stability is everything.
from where i'm standing right now stability is everything.



<a name="maya"><h3>you're in maya</h3></a>
he hit me right in the face.
i drove the falcon uptown.
hung out in the library parking lot.
the swelling'll never go down.
tied a hiram walker in the lining of my father's old corduroy coat.
big, big plans hatching in my brain and a
big ugly lump in my throat.
i drove up to harvey mudd and i played pinball
'till i didn't want to kill anyone.
polished off all my cheap whiskey and stepped out into the california sun.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,
and the juice of the barley for me.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,
and the juice of the barley for me.

my thirst carried me up the coast,
where it only got sharper god damn it.
in a small room that got even smaller a block away from the wilamette.
there was nowhere i needed to go.
and nowhere i wanted to be.
from my window looked out upon nothing.
and nothing looked right back at me.
i had a couple of things on my mind.
a couple of problems to think through.
and i drank 'till i couldn't see straight anymore --
until there was nothing to drink to.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,
and the juice of the barley for me.
singing bainne na mo is a gamna,

<h6>this is a hank williams song</h6>
i could be holding you tonight.
i could quit doing wrong and strt doing right.
you don't care about what i think.
i think i'll just stay here and drink.

you're hurtin' me now, don't square the deal.
at least you'll know the way i feel.
i'll take all the money in the bank.
i think i'll just stay here and drink.

listen close and you will hear
that old juke box playing in my ear.
ain't no woman gonna change the way i think.
i think i'll just stay here and drink.

hurtin' ya now won't mean a thing.
since love ain't here it don't feel the pain.
my mind ain't nothing but a total blank.

but the wallpaper's melting, thoughts turning blue.

and the mad clarinets run away with your heart.

remember that old tune.
the one that you cried to when you fell.
yeah it felt like you'd lost your mind.

you were not twenty-one when he first saw you.
how his melody cheered you, pitch rang so true.
placed your lips to the mouthpiece, struck out a part,
now the mad clarinets run away with your heart.

do you remember that old tune?
the one that you cried to when you fell.
it felt like you'd lost your mind.

when you left that sucker on a moonlit night.
you didn't bother looking left or you wouldn't look right.
you nearly got run over by a ten ton truck.
got your pride you tried to make out like you...

when he received you, your hope simply fell through.
so you cried.
yeah it felt like you'd lost your mind.

katie lied, i was halfway crucified.
i was on the other side of no tomorrow.

just when i'd spent the last piaster i could borrow.
all night long we would sing that stupid song.
and every word we sang i knew was true.

are you with me mr doctor wu?
are you really just a shadow of the man that i once knew?
are you crazy?
are you high?
or just an ordinary guy?
have you done all you can do?
are you with me doctor?
are you with me doctor?

don't seem right, i've been strung out here all night.
i was waiting for the taste you said you'd bring to me.
biscane bay, where the cuban gentleman sleep all day.
i went searching for the song you used to sing to me.
and katie lies.
you can see it in her eyes.
so imagine my surprise when i saw you.

are you with me mr doctor wu?
are you really just a shadow of the man that i once knew?
she is lovely.
yes, she's sly.
and you're an ordinary guy.
has she finally got to you?

<a name="pennsylvania"><h3>pennsylvania dutch treat</h3></a>
brought in the old furnishings from mussel shoals.
up here they burn a lot of brown coal.
and the cars all run on diesel fuel.
the wind comes in from hills to the east,
blowing thirty miles an hour at least.
and the clear blue horizon is smooth and cool.
and the house is like a relic of days gone by.
and it's kinda hard to take, but i try.
i've got a deep need to communicate.
i want so badly to set things straight.
but i can't seem to concentrate deep in the heart of the quaker state.

i had the bed sent in from the west coast.
watched the moving men carry in the old ghosts.
and the purple-ink sky swelled up like a pregnant woman.
saw the lights go up in town.
on the back porch it began to cool down.
but in here, in here, in here it was hotter than an oven.
and the way my blood began to froth and foam,
made it feel just like home.
i've got a deep need to communicate.
i want so badly to set things straight.
but i something tells me it's way too late deep in the heart of the quaker state.



<a name="tampa"><h3>tampa</h3></a>

i know what you did what you did.
yeah, we found him naked in the snow.
down where the wild krokus grow.
and i don't wanna do this anymore.
i ain't wanna fight your dirty little war.

my brother said not to waste another thin dime because
he ain't comin' out next time, and you can
soak in a bathtub full of gasoline, but you will
never get your hands clean.
yeah the building was raging fire was glowing within
you ran out to save your own skin, and
well, i probably shouldn't blame you.
yeah, i probably shouldn't blame you.
but by god, i do,
and i found the photographs in the top dresser drawer
but i ain't gonna fight your dirty little war

when the rainbows disappeared from the skies of northern florida
because the rain had gone away,
and i looked out on the front lawn and i saw you there.
it was 6:31 AM on a saturday.
and you turned into a housecat, 
and you all think i'm making this part up,
but you're wrong, wrong, you're wrong.

and the wind came through the window.
and it my licked at my face.
and i heard the sound of about a thousand housecats
squalling up from all over the place
and you all think i'm crazy
or making up some kind of cute story
or telling little jokes to amuse myself with
but you are wrong.
i am going to dade county right now.

<a name="edwardmunch"><h3>edward munch</h3></a>
radical colors on the eastern sky,
the blinding symmetry,
the little white lie,
your small hand waving in the cold air,
the ridges of the mountain frozen on the skyline there.
when the sun came out over norway today,
i saw you going away.
there was nothing good in your going.
there was nothing good in your going.

i cut the flowers that grew near the door
and i arranged them in the center of the floor.
the room was so empty.
there were pale shadows inside.

i saw you going away.
there was nothing good in your going.

<a name="irony"><h3>the irony engine</h3></a>
<h6>this is a franklin bruno song</h6>
you kept a death grip on the armrest.
you slept while i swerved through bumps and dips.
you lept at the chance to act alarmist.
you swept past my face like an eclipse.

you act like i'm your chum and i can treat you like my little sister.
but if you cover the sun with your thumb you can't expect to get a fever blister.
and if the air is filled with a sickening hum,
don't be upset or overcome.
don't worry. 
it's just the irony engine working.

you rose like a crane to the occasion.
you froze at the very implication.
you chose to divert the whole invasion.
by winking and shrugging and smiling and giving me an awkward seatbelt hug
before you vanished in the chilly autumn.
i could feel the motor chug.
something tearing loose and striking bottom.
and if you still can't see how a three point plug
could superheat on the lunar tug.

i'm gonna drink more whiskey than brendan bean.
and i'm gonna send my belongings all to tripoli.
and i'm gonna ride home to california
with a banjo on my knee.

i'm never gonna turn off the television.
i'm just gonna let it run all night.
i'm gonna plant root vegetables out in the backyard
and come summer i am going to treat you right
so lace up your skates real good.
come on over to my neighborhood.
let's turn this whole place upside-down
and shake it 'til the coins come falling out of its pockets,
yeah put on your chairman mao hat.
you look so god damned cute in that.
we're gonna sail through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets.

i got a great big secret written down somewhere.
i got a rosary to protect us both from harm.
i got a storage locker full of cow figurines
and a laundry list of grievances longer than my arm.
and i am never going back to cincinatti.
all those bridges have burned down to the ground.
i got the jet pack strapped to my back
and i am waiting for you to come around.
so lace up your skates real tight.
be here by six o'clock tonight.
let's turn this whole place upside-down
and shake it 'til the coins come dropping out of its pockets.
yeah put on your chairman mao coat.
and let me clear my throat.
we're gonna sink through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets.
