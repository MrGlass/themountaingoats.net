<a name="butter"><h3>butter teeth</h3></a>
we spilled out through the front door
into the blinding late light
sun reflected on the storefront windows
tremendously bright

we were norwegians come down from the north
attacking the walls of the fortress
I was permenantly at the point of exhaustion
you were gorgeous

who's here? just us
nobody else around
stray electrical currents
trying to find the ground

we haunted the walls of the pharmacy
artlessly shoplifting random things
pain killers, cough syrup, tiger balm
bubble gum, cigarettes, and shower curtain rings

we were portuguese warships cresting the waves
Cannons raised ready to dock
you were counting down the hours and the minutes
I was trying to find a way of stopping the clock

<a name="snakeheads"><h3>snakeheads</h3></a>
weather sailed from northern canada
do in before the afternoon is over
brown cows in the fields
eating their way slowly through the clover

and the canopy of apple trees before us
symmetrical and pure as a pagoda
me and lee chong from chicago in a uhaul
headed out through western Minnesota

headed for the islands
headed for the islands

our load is heavy, you can hear it shifting
say what you like I'm never gonna stop
everyone will eat when we've arrived
white apple blossoms soften up the blacktop

two days from now we'll get to where we're going
the western sky will pitch correct it's whining
our cargo's gonna spill out from the cabin
and rub it's eyes and see the silver lining

yeah yeah

headed for the islands
headed for the islands
