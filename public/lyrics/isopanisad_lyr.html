<a name="abide"><h3>abide with me</h3></a>
abide with me
fast falls the eventide
the darkness deepens, lord with me abide
when other helpers fail, and comforts flee
help of the helpless, lord abide with me

swift to its close
ebbs out life's little day
earth's joys grow dim
its glories pass away
change and decay in all around i see
o thou who changest not,
abide with me.


<a name="ready"><h3>born ready</h3></a>
[spoken:] c'mon william
i'm going to see you in san jose.
i'm going to see you in san jose.
and i'm going to take you out for good.
i'm going to take you down.

i'm headed up the 101 right now.
i'm headed up the 101 right now.
and there's snow on the ground in ohio today.
there's no snow here.

the sun is in my eyes.
yeah the sun is in my eyes.
when i think about you, i feel so bad.
it's been a long, long, long, long time.


<a name="cobscook"><h3>cobscook bay</h3></a>
we're alone most of the time these days.
jill used to come by, but she went away.
and gail used to come around and trash the joint,
but she moved off to dana point.
and you went along, just for the ride,
and you both committed suicide.
and day is breaking over cobscook bay.
and i've never seen anything like it in my life.

cow gave brith and her calves are snow white
the huddle up close together at night.
and the mamma cow leans down and cleans her young.
licking their faces with her tongue, 
and unmarked airplanes buzz the air.
and you're falling off that cliff somewhere in california --
which i've never seen.
i put the pieces all together, but i don't know what they mean,
and day is breaking over cobscook bay.
and i've never seen anything like it in my life.


<a name="dutch"><h3>dutch orchestra blues</h3></a>
somewhere in secret, the dutch orchestra's playing.
somewhere in secret, the dutch orchestra's playing.
real nice.
real nice.

and they play so quiet, you can hear the passing traffic.
they play so quiet, you can hear the passing traffic.
and the cars buzz by, and the wind blows.
and i may walk past/fast?, and i may not.
and someone may notice, or it may all slide right by.
and you may love me, or you may not love me at all anymore.
but the sun will shine on holland in the spring.
and god will watch over the members of the orchestra for me
with all his available energies.
yeah yeah.



<a name="pseudothyrum"><h3>pseudothyrum song</h3></a>
why do you treat me this way?
and why do you try so hard to break my spirit?
i think someone was mean to you when you were little,
that's what i think.
i think someone was mean to you.

why do you cling to such petty points of contention?
and why don't you allow me one or two small victories now and then?
i think someone was mean to you when you didn't deserve it,
that's what i think.
i think someone was mean to you.

but i, i am not that guy.
can you get that straight?
i am a completely different person
from the one you have in mind.

why do you stand by the things you say long after
you don't mean to hurt anybody anymore?
i think someone was mean to you
for a long, long time, that's what i think.
i think someone was mean to you.


<a name="bhakti"><h3>the last limit of bhakti</h3></a>
let me serve you with my mind.
let me serve you with my mind.
let me leave this grieving sand and sky far behind.

let me serve you with my tongue.
let me serve you with my tongue.
let me say your name all day 'til my mouth goes numb.

when the sun comes up, open up the blind.
let me hear the machines grate gears, squeal and grind, yeah.

let me serve you 'til it's over.
let me serve you 'til it's all over.
when the world is giving your secrets all away, 
let me give you cover.

let me serve you with my body.
let me serve you with my body.
let me fight now until the end of time, 
the last limit.
yeah, yeah.
