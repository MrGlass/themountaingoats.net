<h3><a name="wild">wild world</a></h3>
<h6>originally performed by the birthday party</h6>
hold me up baby, for I may fall.
hold my dishrag body tall.
our bodies melt together, we are one.
post-crucifiction, baby
post-crucifiction and all undone.

it's a wild world.
it's a wild world.
la la la la la la la la la
it's a wild world.
hey!
it's a wild world.

church bells ring out the toll of our night.
falling forever forward, forever backward, forever forward, alright.
strophe and antistrophe
strophe and antistrophe hey!
antistrophe c'mon and kiss me tight.
it's a wild world, 
a wild world way up here in your arms tonight.

it's a wild world.
it's a wild world.
it's a wild world.
it's a wild world.
