<a name="chevorlet"><h3>new chevrolet in flames</h3></a>
we were drinking colorado bulldogs
when inspiration struck 
and we knew it was high time 
for us to change our own luck
we cracked a couple coca colas open 
mixed them up with vodka and some coffee liqueur 
poured in some cold milk and raised our glasses high to old friends
my love for you is ninety-eight percent pure. 

but the two percent that remains
has fried the circuits in my brain.

I got out my smoking jacket. 
you put on some fishnets and your smart black beret,
we cut quite a figure in the mirror 
and then we were on our way.
oh would that you would kiss me 
with the kisses of your mouth.
cause your mouth is sweeter than wine 
and has a more complicated history than the american south.

as the evening 
took us in 
you could've popped the tension 
with a safety pin.

we went down to pete brown chevrolet, 
cause pete brown satisfy all your new car needs.
we were nicely oiled by then 
our internal transponders picking up satellite feeds 
from well worn ancient places.
our eager young sales rep handed us the keys.
we drove about three quarters of a mile, 
all that's left for us now are moments like these.

we parked behind the high school away from the light.
and the flames climbed high into the night.

<a name="design"><h3>design your own container garden</h3></a>
I took to the highway, went out to pico-crenshaw.

old friends, old friends.

I took to the highway. The highway took to me like a second skin.
rolled around in the evening, circling like a buzzard.
trouble in mind.

excavating the space we left behind.

yes I took trinkets with me. left them by the crater.

here ghosts, old ghosts.

smelled all the chlorine. I took the low road where the light was just right.
crawled around in the glowing. all embracing wreckage.
sunburned and snow-blind.

excavating the space we left behind.
