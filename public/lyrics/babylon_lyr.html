<h3><a name="ox">
ox baker triumphant</a>
</h3>
I will rise from the swamp where they dumped my private plane,
I'll be clutching the life preserver in my teeth.
and I will find the highway
and I will flag down a truck 
worry lines on my forehead, blank stare underneath

and when I come back to town 
I'm gonna cast my burden down
a little worse for wear
practically walking on air

I will thank my ride and crawl my way back inside 
to the guts of the building where my enemies
hide in the dark like roaches.
and I will signal the camera crew and everyone will do
what he's been trained how to do.
sweat dripping from my face as my moment approaches.

click your heels, count to three.
I bet you never expected me
a little worse for wear
practically walking on air

<h3><a name="alibi">
alibi</a>
</h3>
I got off work just past eleven 
laid one finger to the breeze.
you can almost taste the action
on nights like these.
trees were bending in the wind.
you were forty miles away.
and I was headed in your direction.
I've been waiting all day, I've been waiting all day.

moon over west covena was huge and white.
and I was like a patient on a table,
headed for the light
lean toward the center divider
feel the wind in my hair
keep a light up in your window
I'm gonna be right there, I'm gonna be right there

with a gleam in my eye
and an almost airtight alibi.

down by the chemistry building
I found a quiet place to park.
and I made my way down the street toward your place
stepping lightly in the dark
climbed the steps up to your doorway
like a man prepared to jump underneath a train.
it's real warm outside tonight.
maybe tommorow it rains, maybe tommorow it rains.

inside your room we shut the window
and we turned on a fan.
and we lay there together in the darkness
I can keep a secret if you can.
finishing one another's sentences
like a pair of identical twins.
your boyfriend's out of town until tuesday
and nobody saw me come in, nobody saw me come in.

with a gleam in my eye 
and an almost airtight alibi.

<h3><a name="babylon">
sail babylon springs</a>
</h3>
but meanwhile downstairs, I'm setting up shop.
a little too proud to let the matter drop
and I can hear you up there.
isn't it romantic?
you're huffing and puffing rearranging
deck chairs on the titanic.
and I reach for a glass of cool water drawn,
from the rivers of babylon.

and meanwhile outside, the stars have come out.
and the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout.
and you stand at your window looking down,
and I spread wide my arms.
jump if you want to jump, jump if you want to.
the water's warm.

I know.
I know 'cause i've been swimming.
blindly along through the rivers of babylon.

<h3><a name="bruise">
sometimes I still feel the bruise</a>
</h3>
<h6>Originally by Trembling Blue Stars</h6>
this is just to say hello
and to let you know I think of you from time to time.

I know I never really knew you, but somehow I miss you.
and wish that you'd stayed in my life

making contact gets harder as the silence grows longer.
and isn't it only me

who'd like us to see each other?
how I would hate to be a bother.
the way we left it was you'd ring.

I'm under no illusion
as to what I meant to you
but you made an impression
and sometimes I still feel the bruise
sometimes I still feel the bruise

now and then I stumble on
what I've misplaced but never lost
an ache I first felt long ago

though you've appeared and disappeared
throughout these past few years
I'd be surprised if you now showed.

making contact gets harder as the silence grows longer.
and why would you think of me
when you were not the one in love,
when you were not the dreamer,
when you were just the dream?

I'm under no illusion as to what I meant to you.
but you made an impression, and sometimes I still feel the bruise.
sometimes I still feel the bruise.

<h3><a name="wait">
wait for you</a>
</h3>
when it came time to wait for you,
I took the bus to malibu.
found a cafe by the ocean
watched the sky for signs

and a rainbow in the west
wrapped its coils around the earth like a serpent.
I felt like I was going to suffocate.

but I knew this was not the day you would finally come my way.
but I waited all the same,
watched the water through the window.

and a rainbow in the west
held its head beneath the waves and grew dimmer.
nothing anyone could do I suppose.
