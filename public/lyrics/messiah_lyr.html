<h3><a name="messiah">satanic messiah</a> </h3>
I saw the posters popping up around the city
pale blue and washed out red
I went down to the arena pushing through
hoping I'd run into you
sweet freshly scrubbed smell of the crowd
all the excitement in their eyes
we were all made young when he stepped onto the stage
like an animal escaping from his cage
raise the trumpet
sound the drum
he whom the prophet spoke of long ago has come

all of us too dazed to leave when it was over
dawdled by the vendors for a minute
gathered underneath a summer sky
I was hoping you'd pass by
but thought I didn't see you that day or the next
I'm pretty sure that you were there
making your way among the young and happy hoard
headed down to your reward
raise the trumpet
sound the drum
he whom the prophet spoke of long ago has come

<h3> <a name="wizard">wizard buys a hat</a> </h3>
shuffled up 6th street in the rain
kept my head down as I looked past the people
and in the dept store 
I found what I was looking for
this is the church.
this is the crucible.

they come out to Broadway and they look for me
I'm on the red steps smoking a cigarette
easy to recognize black bandages on my eyes
this is the church.
these are the congregants.

sun sets on the broad square and lights come up
feel like this town's gonna put a quick end to me
but if I came here to drown
I'm gonna take a few people down.
this is the church
occupied by the enemy.

<h3> <a name="sarcofago">sarcofago live</a> </h3>
we were hungry.
there was no food.
we were restless.
there were too many things to do
so we gathered in a concrete room,
eyes up at you.

and in a small room in brazil
we were waiting
and in a small room in brazil
we were waiting

we were howling like dogs.
we were feeling the full brunt of the age.
guys from our neighborhood looking down at us
all of you all of you
rage, rage, rage

and in a small room in brazil
we were waiting
and in a small room in brazil
we were waiting

<h3> <a name="gojam">gojam province 1968</a> </h3>
running like a band of angry schoolboys
up and down the well lit streets today
bashing in the heads of tax collectors
and anybody else who's in our way
bathing in the sunlight that's our birthright
waiting for someone to set the scene
last time he came to town a few stray coins came raining down
we scrambled in the dirt for them like ants around the queen
we take aim for the dawning day
and we shoot
starving to death 
starving to death for the low hanging fruit

then all at once here comes the motorcade
slow and steady down the beaten track
and as we're bashing out the windows of the limo
we notice there's nobody in the back

and the helicopter lands atop the palace
the royal guard assembles at the gate
the country's gonna burn and we'll still have to wait our turn
last among contenders of the super-featherweights
we take aim at the dawning day
and we shoot
starving to death 
starving to death for the low hanging fruit
