<a name="saigon"><h3> saigon: song for anonymity </h3></a>
the last vestiges of the empire were crumbling.
daisies were pushing through the ground.
and i saw a crane disappear beneath still water
on the day when you came back around.
and though time remembers meaningless gestures.
your goodness will not be forgotten while i am still alive.
it was the eighteenth day of may in 1975.

and i asked if we could last a week or two.
and you said you thought we could.
and you came inside to leave the light trickling behind you.
and it was fine and it was good.
and so gleams the single moment before we heard the officers arrive.
on the eighteenth day of may in 1975.
hey.
