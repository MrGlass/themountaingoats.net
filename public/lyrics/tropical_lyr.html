<h3><a name="anti-music">
anti-music song</a>
</h3>
i saw you on tv
doing a bad imitation of van morrison
and i saw you on tv
doing a bad imitation of a second rate songwriter from the eighties named morrissey
i never liked morrissey
and i don't like you.

i saw you tv, 
doing an imitation of an imitation of jimi hendrix
that's really pathetic
and i saw you on tv 
trying to figure out what brian jones would be like if he'd have lived 'til today
i can tell you myself
he'd be like brian wilson
i don't like brian wilson
and i don't like you
i don't like you.

<h3>
<a name="hungary">
going to hungary</a>
</h3>
we touched down in budapest
headed straight for the motel rooom and got undressed
we had not slept for three or four days
and we slipped underneath the covers
it felt ok

about twelve hours later the sun came out to play
i felt it on my eyelids
i pushed your hair away

you put on your old gloves
you put on your new shirt
i put on my cowboy boots
i slipped on my yellow shirt
we headed out, sweat drying on our bodies
and i got all sentimental
we were heading straight to hell
in a lincoln continental

<h3>
<a name="air">
earth air water trees</a>
</h3>
through the shifting colors in the sky
i heard the wild geese call.
and the light was bright and clear and cold
over eastern montreal
and although, i know
you're only toying with me now,
and although, i know
you hold your affection for me like a bone on a string
i love you, i love you because
you gave me sausage and cheese when i was hungry.

you hold your closed hand out to me
and you told me to guess what you had inside
and i had a thousand guesses and some of them were good
but i knew for some reason that i was losing my mind
when the scent came rising
through the spaces between your fingers
when the scent called to me
and i knw we'd last at least until the end of december
i love you, i love you because
you gave me sausage and cheese when i was hungry.
