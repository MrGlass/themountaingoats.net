<h3><a name="badger">
badger song</a>
</h3>
badger time, it runs the same as mine
more or less once you deal with the mechanics
badger faces, all in our places
got no expressions, we offer no clues
won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws?
won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws?

we got the badger song, it isn't very long
sit down and listen this will only take a minute
badgers man, we do what we can
everybody's gonna have to do his part,
now won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws?
take a look, take a good look at my paws?

<h3><a name="that">
that</a>
</h3>
i will praise your eyes
for burning my house down
i am humbled by how they made the framework fall to the ground
i stood with you and watched you
as you made it burn and fall
in minutes it was almost like it had never been there at all
when the traffic on the street thins out for just a second
i will look into your eyes
i, i will not panic
i am standing on the corner
where you and i were standing
i am trying to look at the sky
there are too many colors surrounding me

i will praise your eyes
they have reduced this city to embers
i will see you coming
i will see your eyes through the cold air from a mile away
