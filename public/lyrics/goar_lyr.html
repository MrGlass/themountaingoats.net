<h3><a name="creature">
creature song 
</h3>
i remember the sound of your voice
but none of what you said.
i remember the burning in my body
and the buzzing in my head.
and i do remember your voice
smoothing over my only choice.

oh brave new world
that has such people in it.
oh brave new world
that has such people in it.

i can see the look on your face now
yes i can.
bright light dancing all along your eyes
and you covering your mouth up with your hand.
bracelets jangled against your arm.
no harm intended
no harm.

oh brave new world
that has such people in it.
oh brave new world
brave.



<h3><a name="sound">
pure sound
</h3>

hey.
the air was cooling down
the sky was blue
i was heading north on tailor stret
when i ran into you
we stopped to talk.

right there on the sidewalk
the air was new and clean
i was inbetween times.

the mountains were clearly visible
and your timing was cruel.
you said almost everything right
and your eyes shone like little jewels.
we were talking
while the temperature dropped.
i was hoping against hope
that the wheel would stop.

you were nineteen,
i was inbetween times.
hey.
