<a name="jam"><h3>jam eater blues</h3></a>
life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar.
life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar.
and life is too short to wait around for you to come home tonight.
life is too short, too short to do that.

life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long.
life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long.
i'm gonna lock 'em up tight and eat jam out of the jar all night.
'cause life is too short to make toast, or use spoons or napkins.

life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in tampa.
life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in tampa.
yeah, life is too short to let it go to waste like this,
but I never tasted jam before that tastes like this.
and life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar.



<a name="store"><h3>store</h3></a>
in the five minutes worth of lost time that I had,
when I was passed out on the supermarket floor,
I saw you at the head of the heavenly chorus.
and I heard your song ringing all through the store.

in the five minutes when my broadcast got preempted,
I saw you touch down. you were no longer dead.
I was happy to see ya. i had lots of questions.
and I put my hand to the wound in your head.

ah, the blood!
all of that blood!
all of that warm blood flowing freely from you.

in the five minutes when I was dead to the world,
in a place far away from my friends and my home,
I saw you with a smile on your radiant face,
amidst all of the cans and the glass and the chrome.

and in those five minutes, my signal was jammed.
the frequencies that I received were so pure,
that I almost believed that the sight of the hole in your skull
was a thing that my heart could endure.

ah, the blood!
all of that blood!
all of that warm blood flowing freely from you!



<h3><a name="six">straight six</a> </h3>
dull powder blue paint job,
earl scheib special.
dashboard full of talismans to try and push fate.
rabbit skull hanging from the rearview,
six kicking cylinders, lined up straight,
and I ride.
and I glide down the streets of this city all night, uptight.
jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite.

there's a crack in the windshield eighteen inches long.
evaporating snow forming crystals on the chrome.
brand new battery I shoplifted from the pep boys.
full cranking power to bring me on home,
and I ride.
and I glide down the streets of this city all night, uptight.
jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite.
sometimes the moon shines like a beacon to the weary and the sick in spirit.
sometimes... sometimes it's dark.
