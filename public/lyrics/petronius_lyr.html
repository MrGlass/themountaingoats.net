<h3><a name="doctor">
the bad doctor</a>
</h3>
if you were anywhere near his door
you saw it swing open and you heard the moon roar
trying to yank herself right out of her orbit
the whole natural world, 
painted red, just like a target

it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
on the slow thick morning of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4

and you could feel his features in the air
a wide smile and perfect hair
he had complete control of the rising tides
and a medicine bag hanging at his side

it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
in the flowing blue world of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4

and the rain came down liike water from a faucet
i saw him at the crossroads, but i never saw him cross it,
one minute he was on this side,
and the next he was be over on the other.
so went his rounds, one sad patient after another.

it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
in the crushed velvet world of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4
it was a cold dark day
with low clouds standing in the way
and the stars jockeying for position
in the impossibly large office of the death-dealing physician
(oh yeah) x4


<h3><a name="catalina">
alpha double negative: going to catalina</a></h3>

i hear you starting up again
i seee you standing on the deck
i hear your voice start to carry
i see the veins throbbing in you neck

and i know what you're saying
and i know what you're saying it for
but i'm not listening
i'm not listening anymore

and i see you come toward me
i see the sun slimb down the sky
i hear your voice getting faster and louder
i see a stranger in your eyes

and i know what you're saying
and i know what you're saying it for
but i'm not listening
i'm not listening anymore




<h3>
<a name="intentions">
pure intentions</a>
</h3>
you're a strong one, you're a lion
you're brave, death defyin'
you're in your car, crossing town.
and i can feel you, coming down.

you're so pretty, i could burst
and i wonder, who's gonna talk first
my muscles all shaking, and blood's turned to foam
it's tuesday, and you're coming home.
yeah!


<h3>
<a name="shanghai">
lady from shanghai</a>
</h3>
the waves were beating
against the shore
the waves were beating
as if they hadn't before
the dock was soaking
the wood was wet
your hair blew madly
i can't forget.
we went down to the boat.
we went down to the boat.
yeah!

the rushing water
the pale sky
hey, that's a good way
to let the dock dry
you know what i mean
we were slaves
the word was lurching 
the dark way
as we went down to the boat
we went down to the boat.
we went down to the boat.
we went down to the boat.
yeah!

<h3>
<a name="love">
pure love</a>
</h3>
hey, what's wrong with you?
hey, what are you trying to do?
'cause if what you had in mind
is what i think it is
then it's not very kind
and it won't be necessary
it won't be necessary now
it won't be necessary
it won't be necessary now

hey, what are you doing, my love?
hey, didn't i just tell you that such a thing
would be over and above what's called for in this case
pull the ski mask away from your face
it won't be necessary
it won't be necessary now
it won't be necessary
it won't be necessary now
it won't be necessary
it won't be necessary now
