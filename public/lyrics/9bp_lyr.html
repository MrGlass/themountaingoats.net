<h3><a name="cubs">
cubs in five</a>
</h3>
they're gonna find intelligent life up there on the moon
and the canterbury tales will shoot up to the top of the best seller list
and stay there for 27 weeks

and the chicago cubs will beat every team in the league
and the tampa bay bucs will make it the way to january
and i will love you again
i will love you, like i used to
i will love you again
i will love you, like i used to
 
the stars are gonna spell out the answers to tommorow's crosswords
and the phillips corporation will admit that they've made an awful mistake
and bill gates
will single handedly spearhead the heaven seventeen revival
 
and the chicago cubs will beat every team in the league
and the tampa bay bucs will take it all the way to the top
and i will love you again
i will love you, like i used to
and i will love you again
i will love you, like i used to

<a name="utrecht">
going to utrecht</a>
</h3>
in the morning, i looked down
through the 3rd story window overlooking town
across the water, somewhere, you were sleeping over there
i couldn't believe it, i couldn't belive it.
not if i saw it with my own eyes,
(with my own eyes) x4

in the morning, i looked down
through the 3rd story window overlooking town
and i saw you. and i know you saw me too.
i couldn't belive it. i couldn't believe it.
not if i saw it with my own eyes,
(with my own eyes) x4

<h3>
<a name="cheshire">
cheshire county</a>
</h3>
when the sun came up, i got up
'cause you were saying my name backwards in your sleep again

the field outside was wet and green, 
and the most goergeous cow i've ever seen
was coming right at me, right at you

her udder was fat with fresh milk
and her black and white coat was as smooth as silk
and in the waning of a long long year
i felt the remnants of last night disappear
(disappear) x7

<a name="chanson">
chanson du bon chose</a>
</h3>
E                 F
saw the sycamore underneath the moon

Am                            C                        D
i was waiting for something & you were sleeping in the living room

E                              F
and it was five-sixteen a.m. - the air was sharp and cool

Am                                 C            D
and i wondered where you buried our dark little jewel

G                    D
and the heat rising, in the room

C                    D
i am digging graves. i am digging graves

G                                D
and the water boiling, on the stove

C                            D
i am digging graves. i am digging graves
 


so i held you close to me
i saw the shadows start to gather outside beneath the sycamore tree
and something was changing
this was something here entirely new
bursting into blossom inside of us both with the sun coming up and
me holding onto you
 
and your body breathing on mine
i am digging graves. i am digging graves
and your hands running through my hair
i am digging graves. i am digging graves

"...lofi, we hebben het voortaan maar over eh.. bifi, dat lijkt me maar 
het beste."
                                 -or-

"...lofi, from now on we'll talk about ehm.. bifi, i think that's 
better." 

waves crashed all around and near your body
the waves came all over you
and i saw the sky reflected on the ocean
deadly blue 

yeah
(i used to know you) x4
 
<h3>
<a name="toys">
i know you've come to take my toys away</a>
</h3>
sun flashing red and then orange then opting for secession
on the day when you came to the door with you terrible confession
i know you've come to take my toys away and 
i know you've come to take my toys away
 
skin flushing red and then glowing when you come inside
and the moonlight watching all over you i have got my mouth open wide
i know you've come to take my toys away and
i know you've come to take my toys away

and when it drops, you're gonna feel it. 
oh yeah
oh yeah
 
<h3>
<a name="poppies">
nine black poppies</a>
</h3>
when i got home i meant to give you some sweet chrysanthemum
the wind chimes were ringing all wrong and you were standing 
in the doorway singing along
and i tried to rememeber how nice it had been
a long long time ago
but i couldn't rememeber.
i honestly could not remember
 
and a package came for you today, from the hunan province
the postmark burning jet black in the summer sun
someone was changing. someone was changing from the inside out
and i turned around to face you.
 
sweet peas in the garden, all in full bloom
and i thought i heard the traces of an old song murmuring in the room
like a half-remembered conversation, i let it slip away
and then i could not rememeber
i honestly could not remember
 
and a package came for you today, from the hunan province
the postmark burning jet black in the summer sun
someone was changing. someone was changing from the inside out
and i turned around to face you.

<a name="stars">
stars fell on alabama</a>
</h3>

G                D          Cadd9              G
you looked real calm as we made our way up the walk

G                D      Cadd9               G
there were lazy kisses, hands brushing and small talk	

G             D    Em                  C            G      D    G
the moon was high, your smooth face was dry, and the kudzu grew
 
G             D           Cadd9    G
and the stars fell on alabama

G            D                G
and your eyes filled up with light

G            D            Em  C  G    D    G
and the stars fell on alabama
 


the warm earth underneath us gave way
dry grass crinkled like paper as a breeze came in across the bay
cold clean water nearby, glimmered in your eyes 
and your pistol glistened.

and the stars fell on alabama
and your eyes filled up with light
and the stars fell on alabama

but if you think i'll take a bullet for you - you're dreaming.
