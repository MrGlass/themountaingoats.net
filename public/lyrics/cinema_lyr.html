<h3><a name="cao">
Cao Dai Blowout
</h3>

he came knocking down the street lights
tearing up the new grass on the lawn.
he was frightening off the livestock.
I could feel him coming on.
I lit the citronella, it was all that I had.
and I began to feel real bad.
when the ghost of your father comes to town
what the hell else can you do?
I flung open all the windows,
put the water on for tea,
and let him pass right through.

and he took to knocking over furniture,
getting into the reception on the wireless.
he tore up all the dry goods in the pantry.
he was strong and he was tireless.
and when the priest came to call, I sent him on his way.
I got a tremor in my hands and my feet are made of clay.
when the ghost of your father starts pushing you around
how are you gonna make him stop?
I took down all the crosses.
I let him set up shop.



<h3><a name="korean">
korean bird paintings
</h3>
yesterday I put in a good 5 hours talking to the statues.
chased your memory all around the room
didn't manage to catch you.
but I cleaned out the savings account
blew everything I had on flowers
covered up the furniture in carnations
rolled around for hours

there are those of you, who got the wrong idea right now
but man you should of seen me when I got through
indistinguishable from a fourth century Briton
waiting on the couch for you
I put all the extras on the credit card
mobiles of the galaxy and mylar balloons
everything we'd saved up in one room at the same time
cartoon stars, crescent moons
thank you notes, get well cards
condolences, congratulations
bright colors, hues and signals
reminders and reverberations

Narakaloka
</h3>

the cabbages that I will grow
one by one and row by row
will fatten in the spring sun
and breathe in the evening air.

and you will hear them breathing
if you walk by at night.
and you may not hear them after all,
but that's alright.

I've set the table for two.
I've cleaned the windows for you.
I got cinnamon from Jakarta
for making French toast.
the doctor says that I've got
thirty days left at most.

the cabbages that I will grow,
the love songs on the radio,
will deepen in the springtime
they'll be brighter than the stars.



<h3><a name="jackal">
golden jackal song
</h3>

well I swung through town
shining like a new quarter
felt something sharp rise up within me
when I crossed the border.
stopped at the gas station payphone
I let my fingers fly.
the wicked impulses were dying,
but I couldn't let them die.
and we were over at your place
singin' about the old times.
no one had anything to prove.
I ate so much carrion that I could not move.
I was bloated.

when I saw your kitchen
glistening like the old country
all your cups and glasses
lined up in front of me
and I stopped at the faucet for a minute.
waited 'til you came in to see what was wrong
and your fingers brushed my ribs playfully
and I played along.
and you had your tongue in my mouth.
your eyes glistening in the light
I ate rich, raw carrion 'til I couldn't think right.
I was full.



<h3><a name="treetop">
treetop song
</h3>
All along the interstate
the palm trees were calling out to me
the line of them stretched fown the highway forever
as far as I could see.
and I waited 'til the sun was coming up
light morning traffic and a cool spring breeze
and I heard the old voices calling down to me from the tops of the trees.

and when I got up to the top, my head got light
and for a minute everything in the world was alright.
and I saw the next tree just 10 feet away
give or take a few feet I guess.
and then I pushed off into the air with all my might
and headed out into the center of the morning light
and I knew that I was gonna make it.
the new tree hardly shook to acknowledge my arrival
and I knew that I would be alright.
