<h3><a name="infidelity">
infidelity</a>
</h3>
there was a twinkle in my eye
as we watched the fish swim by
we saw the water going in and out
and you knew what i was thinking about

we watched the water
we looked right through it
and i let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
like there was nothing to it

three of them hiding behind a rock
and i got too nervous to talk
with your wondrous form all stretched out
right next to me as the fish swam about

we watched the water
we looked right through it
and i let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
like there was nothing to it

the room heated up the windows were closed
we heard the humming of the air hose
that ran into the tank and the fish swam in place
and i fixed my eyes on your beautiful face

we watched the water
we looked right through it
and i let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
like there was nothing to it

<h3><a name="lubbock">
going to lubbock</a>
</h3>
he drove north out of dallas on a tuesday afternoon
the summer wind was sweet in his mouth
as the engine whistled a solitary tune
ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere
among the rocks and the tumbleweeds and the dust
he popped the trunk and he pulled out a shovel
and pumped the dull blade through the earth's tough crust
when he dug up the human skull that was bigger than a basketball
he took one step back
he took one step back
into the sunlight

he stood there by the roadside
underneath the clear blue sky
and ancient stories ran through his mind
as the certain detail caught his eye
there was a pronouned depression along the skull's occipital bone
space burned in the dry june sun
and his forehead dripped like an ice cream cone
he laid the skull down gently in the back seat
and in his mouth the summer wind was sweet
he took one step back
he took one step back
into the sunlight

<h3><a name="malevolent">
malevolent cityscape x</a>
</h3>
the street's alive
we're not alone
our legs move like well-oiled gears
and i know we're never going home
there is a dwarf on the corner
with a cup in his hand
a black hat on his big head
he sings a little song and then the sky turns red

and just now
when i catch sight of you
in the burning sun
you strike me as mean-spirited

let the dwarf come out
let the old songs come
the scales tip back
and the arpeggiates can run
once i knew what to say to you
now the words will not come through
and i love you underneath a red sky
but for the life of me i couldn't say why

and just now
when i catch sight of you
in the burning sun
you strike me as mean-spirited
