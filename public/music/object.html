<h2>quote:</h2<
<h3>On returning to my hometown of Claremont, California, on the
occasion of a friend's wedding in July of 1997, i was greatly saddened 
to learn that the Bang Luck Market had closed. Since the early '80s
the Bang Luck had been the only Asian market east of the San Gabriel
Valley that could lay true claim to the title "Supermarket." They had
it all at the Bang Luck: Filipino canned goods, Korean ramen, Thai
medicinals, Vietnamese pickled jackfruit, Japanese candies, and Golden 
Boy Peanuts, which were remarkable for their packaging, for their
country of origin, and for the inclusion of "salt" in the listed
ingredients. I ate hundreds of them on numerous and diverse occasions, 
and I can assure you that no jury in the world would convict them of
having been salted.</h3>
