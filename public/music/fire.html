<h2>quote: in theory, if we who presently claim to be human were to 
forget our efforts to find the traces of divine movements in our own 
actions, our fate should be something like the people in popol vuh. for 
them, the forgotten force of divinity reasserted itself by inhabiting 
their own tools and utensils, which rose up against them and drove them 
from their homes. today they are swinging through the trees.  --dennis
