<h2>quote: 
<P>
<b>long-tailed weasel</b><i>  mustela frenata</i>
<P>
like the related skunks, mink, and badger, weasels have five toes. but in 
weasels the fifth toe is small, so that tracks usually just show four 
toes. all weasels are quick and agile, with long, slim bodies that enable 
them to enter narrow crevices and burrows in persuit of small mammals, 
reptiles, and frogs; they also prey on birds. in turn, they are captured 
by hawks, owls, foxes, and large snakes.

<h2>quote 2:
<P>
ran away from the nine month ice blast of portland to las vegas, eyes 
bloodshot, our bodies coming alive with fear. we checked into a ground 
floor room at the stardust and went to sleep for two days. three years 
later you got pregnant and the tickets to florida were cheap, cheap. it 
was either florida or california and that was just out of the question.
