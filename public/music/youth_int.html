<h1>on the value of overstating the obvious</h1>


(from jaboni youth #4)

    recently i had the good fortune to hear a new song by cash nexus.  i was 
never told the title, and most of the lyrics went the way of all flesh, 
but its refrain (which couldn't properly be called a "chorus," as it just 
kept popping up like a half-remembered dream rather than reoccurring at 
regular intervals like a bad relationship) has stuck with me for days on 
end.  it came up last night, and then it went away for a little while, 
but now it's back.  its lovely third-second-tonic progression may have 
been a good part of its tenacity, but given the paucity of the written 
word to convey melody, i'll stick to the lyric here.  this is it:

 *sad, sad, sad
  that i busted both my knees.*

i would like to advance the case that the quality which has allowed these 
lines to settle themselves so permanently in my mind and which makes them 
truly great is the quality of overstatement; i would like further to 
suggest that it is this quality which has always gone into the making of 
great american songs, and which any american working in song ignores only 
at his peril.
    the "ground" -- the circumstances which must precede the utterance of 
the above lyric -- is this: the singer has somehow broken both of his knees.
there are a number of places one could with this.  one might dwell on the 
excruciating pain of a broken bone, let alone two of them, and those two 
of the hardest to repair; one might bewail the circumstances which led to 
the breaking of said knees.  one might assign blame, or lament the lack 
of a place on which to cast blame.  cash nexus chooses none of these.  
instead, he overstates, taking the external fact inward and finding the 
most obvious thing about the deplorable circumstance and making it the 
thing to which he and we return again and again:

 *sad, sad, sad
  that i busted both my knees.*

a lesser singer would not be content with sadness; after all, both of his 
knees are broken.  a lesser singer would launch into a full verse, maybe 
even two, describing the fullness of the feeling in question.  nexus instead
says that he is "sad."  what is remarkable about this is its very 
obviousness, which resonates deeply within a listener who is accustomed 
to hearing exclusively what is not obvious: i mean, of course, the modern
listener, who has been culturally prepared to look for the anomalous and 
who ignores the things that any fool could see right in front of his face.
these sorts of things -- simple sadness, mild disappointment, fleeding 
delight -- have receded into the background of popualr song; should they 
or their emblems present themselves (as the case in "macarthur park"), 
they quickly become vehicles for the same grand tumults of emotion to 
which so many songwriters seem tethered.  your author here does not claim 
to have broken free from this tether; it's the strength of the tie which 
makes nexus's success seem all the more stunning.  but while i and so many  
others believe we are overstating when we are in fact only exaggerating, 
nexus understands that, to overstate, one need only find the one thing 
which would be easily apprehended by the most facile listener and then 
say it, over and over:

 *sad, sad, sad
  that i busted both my knees.*

    "is that all?" cries the jaded listener.  "is that all: 'sad'?"  but 
this listener has missed the point.  should the singer skip immediately past
the sadness to address more complicated issues, the sadness will never go 
away.  what is accomplished by overstatement and repetition in a song 
like this is twofold: the feeling is addressed -- "dealt with" -- by the 
singer, and is concurrently inflicted on the listener, who can't get rid 
of the sadness once the melody has come to rest in his brain.  in this manner
the singer accomplishes that which has always been the goal of american 
artists, viz., to become god almighty, manipulating the interior states 
of his subjects simply by speaking a word here or there.  he does not ask 
that he be invited into the lives of his subjects, nor does he beg 
forgiveness should he impose (as would any british artist, though less so 
after the 1960s).  instead he just starts singing, taking for granted 
that the listener wants to hear, and, once he has been allowed inside, 
encodes himself therein like a new gene.
    the end-product of such songwriting is something more profound than 
communication.  it is more like communion: the singer lives inside the 
listener for a moment, and the listener, unable to shake the aggressively 
simple third-secord-tonic melody, is forever changed.  such songwriting is
exactly what we americans who write songs should be doing.  cash nexus is 
not the only one working in this manner -- jon spencer comes to mind -- 
but he is one of a select few.  of course, when the new mountain goats 
material comes to light, fat with the same exaggeration (which, don't get 
me wrong, still gives me the thrill) and thin on the sort of overstatement
i've been talking about here, you'll all call me a hypocrite, but i am used
to that sort of thing by now.

are several members.  don't let anyone tell you different.  however, he 
will soon be one of two members of the mountain goats.  don't ask.*
