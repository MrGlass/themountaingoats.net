      hey everyone. well this was my first show since last summer, and i was 
      quite ready for it. it was especially great since it was my
      girlfriend's first show, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. this was 
      part of <a href="http://kickbright.com/FLPopfest">popfest</a>. a show put on by a guy named michael in 
      talahassee (mike, i never met you, but had a great time!). what
      i saw of the festival was really great. john came on around
      2345. he finished up around 80 minutes later. the show was
      superb. here are some highlights:

      family happiness - new song. the title comes from a tolstoy
      short story. an AMAZING song... if you want to be bitter, listen 
      to this. oh wow! i can't say enough.

      alpha sun hat - a really great version of this one.

      john did break a string, but for the first time was ever was
      prepared with a second guitar (family happiness is in an
      alternate tuning).

      ok. enough here's what he played:

      raid on antebbe
      tulsa imperative
      grendel's mother
      orange ball of love
      some swedish trees
      masher
      we were patriots
      waving at you
      snow crush killing song
      I corinthians 13:8-10
      family happiness

      there will be no divorce
      minnesota
      third snow song
      alpha double negative - going to catalina
      orange ball of hate
      alpha sun hat
      going to georgia

      weekend in western illinois
      new star song
      cubs in five


      the next day at 1400, john played an in-store at vinyl fever. the
      first three songs made my heart happy. here we go:

      going to alaska
      alpha in tauris
      going to jamaica
