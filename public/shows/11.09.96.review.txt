This weekend, I saw the Mountain Goats playing live, at Zwijnzicht a
small club in Dordrecht. I arrived a bit too late, so I missed the first
songs of Them & Me, who opened that day. It was a pity (the fact that I
missed the first few songs, not the fact they opened!), cause they were
really good. One guy on an acoustic guitar, someone else playing bass.
Hard to believe these guys usually play in Bortherhood Foundation a
skatepunk-band, who have a large fanbase in Holland.
Second was Birdskin, which is the band of Peter from Plover. Great
Sebadoh-ish indie-noise-rock-pop. Check out they're fine 7" on Rotten
Windmill.
Then, finally came John and Peter, aka the Mountain Goats. The first
songs John played solo on his acoustic guitar. Some new, unreleased
songs and soem from Nothing For Juice. Then Peter joined him and they
played alot of great songs: Alpha Omega (the best 'goats song on a
comp.), Tollund Man, a Propagandi-cover, a cover by a punk-band from
Northern California and many many others. They finished (maybe a bit
cliche, but really cool!) with Going To Georgia. This really was an
excellent show, maybe the best one I've ever seen!! Even though they
only palyed about an hour, due tot he fact John was a bit sick.

Talked to John and Peter after the show who are really nice people!

C'ya, Martijn

PS: recently bought the Secret Stars-CD. Really great, go buy it all!!
