again, simon was really good. he played milk which was a nice change of 
pace from some of the slower stuff.

john was excellent (do ireally even have to write that anymore?) he 
(amazingly) stuck to the setlist for a (gasp) 9 songs. then he said he 
had not learned a song (sheffield), and played erin's request of <i>tulsa 
imperative.</i>

i yelled for <i>cutter</i>, and got it, seemingly breaking my "john won't play 
my requests" streak, but i later learned it was on the setlist, so i 
don't count it as a true request. the streak contines.

a <b>very</b> good new song called <i>the car song</i>, which should have 
been on the hot garden stomp, but wasn't. 

other highlights were alpha in tauris, the hot garden stomp, and 
quetzelcoatl is born. but enough...
