JD here. Got some news. Here follows that news:

The South Dakota show is a brand-new addition about which I am excited.  

Incidentally, the tour title "Ornery as Pigs" is only the latest in
a long series of possible tour names and probably won't be retained,
though I'll bet Simon digs it.

Much love from Iowa where it's pretty nice today, all things considered,

John
