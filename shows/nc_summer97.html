simon -- excellent. (thanks for playing milk, simon.)

john. on fire. 23, count 'em 23 songs. another song that i didn't know. 
it was great. well, i finally broke the streak. i yelled for 02-75 in the 
encore and got it, so i'll stop rambling every review about how i never 
get my requests. but obviously, the fact i got it, means that i'm not 
yelling for obscure enough material.

highlights are too plantiful to name. here's the damage:

Saigon: song for anonymity
going to bolivia
west country dream
masher
chanson du bon chose (erin)
grendel's mother
US mill
stars around her
baboon
some swedish trees
night of the mules
downtown seoul
spet 19th triple x love! love!
new star song
the bad doctor
snow crush killing song
minnesota
orange ball of hate
going to georgia

encore the first:
02-75 (jon)
twin human highway flares (erin)
nine black poppies

encore the second:
cubs in five
