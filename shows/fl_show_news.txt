Hi Jonathan,

The Mountain Goats play Friday February 6th at the Cow Haus in Tallahassee
with Of Montreal, True Love Always, Silver Apples, Kincaid, Gritty Kitty and
Elf Power.  The door is $7, all ages.  Show should start around 6:30.  On 
Saturday, it's Neutral Milk Hotel, Racecar, The Gerbils, The Music Tapes,
Flowchart, Gumption, and Congratulations.  Also $7, also all ages, also
6:30 showtime.

John might also be doing an in-store at a record store (Vinyl Fever) on that
Saturday afternoon, but we haven't finalized that yet.  It would probably be
around 2 in the afternoon.


thanks for your interest, and take care
michael
