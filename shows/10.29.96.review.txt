Ok list, now I have time to write a little about the show MGs played 
in Stockholm on October 29. Here are some thinhs that happened:

* First Peter and John played together. I'm afraid I don't remember 
all the songs, but that doesn't matter.

* John took a break and Peter played 4 songs solo: Trow-away, a song 
by Swedish artist Tia,  Meat Bee cave (from the new Furniture one 
tape), and one Diskoti-q song (or maybe two)

* Peter went off and John played alone for a (long) while. He broke a 
string and while Peter fixed the guitar John took the bass and 
confessed that he used to play bass in The Congress. After one song 
on bass he did an acapella version of The Irony Engine. It was 
beautiful.

* Both players finished the show and play some extras, ending with 
the sign. They also played Housegest by Franklin (I'm not 100% thats 
the title of the song)

* After the show they sold stuff. Peter got rid off all his 7" and 
tapes (about 20 7" and 3 tapes). John sold some cds. 

Tonight I'm seeing them in Linkoeping. (They play 5 dates in 
Sweden!!!)
