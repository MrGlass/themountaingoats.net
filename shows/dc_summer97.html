<h3>

my second show of this tour, and an excellent one. simon was really 
good. i got to baltimore late, and missed his set there, so this was 
the first time i had seen him. good, good stuff.

<i>down here</i> was especially great since john used the line "japanese 
red clowns train by the water here", which was coined by yours truly. 
other highlights included sun song, song for an old friend, and dr. wu, 
where john, for the second time i've seen him perform this, goes blank on 
one line. 

per usual, i did not get my request. tonight i yelled for <i>i've got the 
sex</i>, under the guise of "the original first song off of sweden"

this show was also great because i got to meet my friend erin mcwilliams, 
who is, quite possibly, as obsessed as i am about the Mountain Goats.
