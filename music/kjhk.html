<h1>interview with john darnielle on kjhk-lawrence</h1>
<h2>sunday, march 2nd, 1997.</h2>
<p>
[the interviewer for kjhk is, i believe, michael
weiner, who co-hosts a weekly lo-fi show on kjhk, called &quot;the
lo-fi aesthetic.&quot; kjhk also does a netcast. i recorded the
following interview via real audio and transcribed it. i'm missing
the last few minutes though. hopefully, however, that will be
forthcoming. enjoy! --jonathan maier 3/22/97]<br>
<p>
 kjhk: hello, we're back, uh, on our little lo-fi
experiment show here. joining me is, is john darnelle- 
<p>
 john: darnielle 
<p>
 kjhk: darnielle, i'm sorry-of the mountain goats.
how are you doing this afternoon? 
<p>
 john: i am fine, thank you. 
<p>
 kjhk: how was the drive in? 
<p>
 john: it was fine. can you shut that door? i'm kind
of phobic about open doors. 
<p>
 kjhk: sure. okay. you'll be playing at the replay
lounge tonight. 
<p>
 john: yes, i will. am i audible? do i need to be
closer to that mic? 
<p>
 kjhk: uh, no. i think you're coming in just fine. 
<p>
 john: okay. 
<p>
 kjhk: um, let's see i have a couple of questions
prepared, and then will see how this goes. when did you start
recording? 
<p>
 john: um.. 
<p>
 khjk: the mountain goats 
<p>
 john: um. . . 91 i think. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. how did you choose the name "the
mountain goats?" 
<p>
 john: um. . .  i don't really know, i mean-i was-the
first recordings i did, uh, i was working at metropolitan state
hospital in norwalk. i was making money hand over fist and so
i bought any record that struck me as remotely interesting at
that point in time-hello there-um, uh, and so i bought this-i
started following this philosophy that a couple friends of mine
have that says if you have a really strong reaction against something,
you should buy the record, right? and find out why. and if it's
really strong-if you hear and you say "ughhhhhhh! it makes
me sick!" like the people who hear the cure and can't stand
the way robert smith sings, they should buy cure records and,
and get more acquainted with them, because you really only hate
something if you're indefferent to it, is the way i think about
it. so anyway, uh, i'd always hated frankie valie and the four
seasons. and uh, so i bought their complete singles collection,
and it turned out they were not so bad, and i thought i would
do versions of it myself because i had nothing better to do and
i had bunches of money. so i bought a guitar and a tape-deck.
i bought a hawaiian , uh, slide guitar and decided i was going
to record all these things. and it wasn't for anything in particular.
i wasn't hooked up with any, anybody who put out tapes or anything,
i just thought it would be a funny idea and i, just landed on
the name of the mountain goats because i had been screaming jay
hawkings and he says, uh, he mentions mountain goats in a song
called "big yellow coat", so, and the more i thought
about it, the more i thought it was appropriate because i had
been learning things about mountain goats, like how they, uh,
every year thousands of mountain goats plummet to their death
because they have these special hooves that are adapted. they
can climb almost vertical angles, but they get really cocky, because
they can do this. and i mean, it's like, if there's a mountain
over here, on the left, and there's a mountain goat over here,
and there's a cleft in between, right? if they jump and land on
an angle, that's uh, i don't know anything about angles, so. . . an
extremely steep angle, their hooves are made in such a way that
they can grab as though they were claws grabbing rock, but they're
not. it's just the way the hooves are. so, many of them will see
a nice jump and go "ya! i can jump that!" right? and
then they jump. and, but if they hit a solid vertical wall they're
not going to be able to cleave and they fall, and this is the
major killer of mountain goats, and i just thought that was pretty
amazing, that, ya know, you have that sort of vanity in the animal
kingdom. i thought it was great, so, so uh, i'm just an animal
fiend, so i, so i wanted an animal name that, that-and i also
like the resonance of it. it's a, it's a, it's an iambic, uh,
uh dipod-the mountain goats-right? 
<p>
 kjhk: right. 
<p>
 john: so, and the english majors will like hearing
that and anybody else will wonder what i'm talking about. 
<p>
 khjk: right, that's, that's interesting that you
bring up the fact of uh, english majors 
<p>
 john: uh-huh 
<p>
 kjhk: in this whole tape scene movement. andy here
is an english major. i myself was an english major. uh, so-- 
<p>
 john: and you both see how much money it's already
brought you? 
<p>
 kjhk: as a matter of fact, yes. 
<p>
 john: money and joy. 
<p>
 kjhk: so, why uh, why, why are so many english majors
attracted. . .  
<p>
 john: to music? 
<p>
 kjhk: to, well, this, this particular home, home
recording- 
<p>
 john: well, i think probably because, if you're an
english major who is into writing songs, then you want to write
fairly literate songs, and that cancels out much popular appeal,
right? um, except sporadically, ya know, uh, you get the occasional
aberration who can write a poppy enough hook, and can, uh, or
get away with it, like bob dillon, right? or leonard cohen, but
he's not making a whole lot of money. so, uh, but i mean i think
that's why. i think it's an interesting branch of literature that
also allows a lot less, allows for a lot, a lot more lazy approach
to things than do novels or poetry, and the poetry scene is in
such horrible disarray that if you want to write something like
poetry, you'd do better to go into song than poetry, 'cause the
state of american poetry is, is just in shambles, ya know. 
<p>
 kjhk: uh-huh. do you write poetry? 
<p>
 john: i used to. i, i stopped writing poetry when
i started writing songs, more or less. 
<p>
 kjhk: do you write characters and use them throughout
different songs, or just-- 
<p>
 john: ya! 
<p>
 kjhk: you do? 
<p>
 john: uh-huh, i mean i don't give them names or anything, 
<p>
 kjhk: but, the different-- 
<p>
 john: like the 'alpha guy'. . . there's the 'alpha
couple' 
<p>
 kjhk: there's, there's an alpha couple, 
<p>
 john: ya 
<p>
 kjhk: the same couple, the same throughout all the
"alpha" songs? 
<p>
 john: generally speaking. once in a while i cheat,
'cause i just have a title i want to use, but almost all the songs
are the same 'alpha couple,' and there's a specific thing that's
going on with them. 
<p>
 kjhk: have, have you written a story line, and then
you, you use that to write the songs? or. . .  
<p>
 john: no! that's what's great about it, though. if
you just have like, the bare bones, like you know what's, how
it's supposed to end, right? and so you write songs and you think
of these characters. well, you don't, but i do, um, uh, and, and
uh, ya know, then you surprise yourself. i mean, it was supposed
to end in divorce. it ended, uh, the last one is on a very obscure
compilation, which is horribly unfair, but um, but, uh-- 
<p>
 kjhk: is that that theme park song? 
<p>
 john: ya, that's, that's it. 
<p>
 kjhk: actually i think i have that here. 
<p>
 john: there's the last one, although other ones came
out after it, but, but in the narrative line, that's the end,
right? and they were supposed to get a divorce. the whole thing
was supposed to be about them moving up to a divorce, but then
they didn't get a divorce. uh, she just bailed. 
<p>
 kjhk: did you write them in order? 
<p>
 john: no, no. 
<p>
 kjhk: no? uh, what about the other series? there's
the "going to". . .  
<p>
 john: yeah. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: that would be  a series? 
<p>
 john: that's real loose, though. it's real loose. 
<p>
 kjhk: different characters? 
<p>
 john: yeah, there, there's  no main "going to"
character. 
<p>
 kjhk: uh, the "orange ball" series and
the "pure"-- 
<p>
 john: the "orange ball" is super-duper,
look, really they're not related, and neither are the ones with
the "pure" title. those tend to be like, like, uh. . . out
of any series at all, something that's not even thematically connected
to the other stuff i'm writing about usually. 
<p>
 kjhk: what, what are the thematic connections of,
of those series? are there any? 
<p>
 john: ummm. no, there's, there's a thematic connection
between the ones that aren't in sequence, right? i mean the ones
that are out of any series tend to all be about issues of loss,
right? um, of some sort or another. and, then, uh, ya know "pure
love"-what's the one on the simon joyner split? "pure
heat," right? um, these are, these are single stories that
are kind of, kind of intently focused in way that i think i don't
force myself to be on the other ones, that i, i let them be looser,
because i think looser, generally is better, but it's also less
accessible, ya know? and uh, the "pure" songs tend to
be more immediate, and people like 'em, although they never remember
the titles. 
<p>
 kjhk: (laughter) uh, do, do you start out with a
title, or. . .  
<p>
 john: sometimes. there's no set- 
<p>
 kjhk: or do you write a song and then you, you realize
what, what the theme is and, and then decide to put it in the
"alpha" series or- 
<p>
 john: back and forth. i mean there's no. . . sometimes
i start with a title, sometimes i start with just lyrics. i mean,
more often these days i start with a title. um, but uh, but i
didn't use to, ya know? but i write differently now. for the last,
well no. for the two albums that i'm presently working on, right?
i uh, i was working more intentionally than i usually do. i was,
ya know, meaning to do a specific thing with a specific song with
a specific sequence of them, and so, um, i would write down a
title and then work, and then ya know, i would have the title
in my mind for a couple of weeks knowing what i wanted to do with
it. um, whereas i used to just sit down with a guitar, find out
whether the muse was on me, and if it was, start writing, and
then throw a title on it somewhere in the middle, but, but now
i usually start with a title. 
<p>
 kjhk: you have, you have two albums in the works
right now? 
<p>
 john: yeah, well there's one that's done and canned
and it'll--i just got the cd-r back in the mail, uh, uh the other
day, and it'll be out on june the 10<sup>th</sup>, um and then
i'm almost finished writing-- 
<p>
 kjhk: that won't be on ajax, though? 
<p>
 john: no, uh, ajax is closed.  
<p>
 kjhk: right. 
<p>
 john: uh, it'll be on emperor jones. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. 
<p>
 john: and it will be out on june the 10<sup>th</sup>,
and i've seen the cover proofs and it's really gorgeous, um, and
it's got alistair galbraith again on two songs, just, knocked,
knocked one of them clean out of the park, uh, and then peter
hughes and bob durkee help out on two others, and it sounds really
good. 
<p>
 kjhk: that, that takes care of another question i
had. brad rose from tulsa, oklahoma wanted me to ask you if, if
he'll-peter hughes-that is, will be playing on the new album? 
<p>
 john: ya, he's on two songs. 
<p>
 kjhk: he toured europe with you? 
<p>
 john: yes he did, twice. 
<p>
 kjhk: twice? 
<p>
 john: yeah. in the spring and then in the fall. 
<p>
 kjhk: how did that tour go? 
<p>
 john: uh, the first one went pretty great; the second
one went pretty awful. 
<p>
 kjhk: pretty awful? 
<p>
 john: yeah, i mean except for sweden, um and for
me, i went over to the united kingdom and the republic of ireland,
and that was great! i mean, but uh, ya know, we're in kansas. . . i
think i can safely say that we should re-bomb germany here without
fear of offending anybody. 
<p>
 kjhk: (laughter) 
<p>
 john: uh, peter and i get-i got fed up with germany
in the spring. peter didn't, uh, but he saw what i meant in the
fall. it was just disastrous. we lost money, basically-- 
<p>
 kjhk: oh wow 
<p>
 john: --is why it was bad. um, and you don't tour
for the pleasure of it, at least i don't. and peter doesn't, i
mean, ya know, he gave up a good paying job, because we made good
money in the spring, so he thought, "well, i'll make more!"
right? but it didn't work out that way. at all. it was bad. but,
uh, but then ireland was soooo good for me that it made the whole
thing worth while. i mean, ireland was amazing, and scotland was
pretty good, and england was all right. 
<p>
 kjhk: you don't enjoy touring? 
<p>
 john: um, i do and i don't, ya know, i mean, i've
gotten so used to it because i've been, ya know, i spent four
or five months on the road in the past year, and i'm the sort
of person who, ya know, if i'm doing something for a long period
of time, i'm going to wind up liking it to a certain extant, and
i'm not the kind of person who can bare a grudge against my current
circumstances for very long, ya know, i will give in rather than,
rather than make a change. ha! so, so i mean it's all right. it
has, it has it's great points. ya know stockholm, sweden uh, was
a show that was so good, that, that i would do the whole tour
again just to do that show. i mean, it was just amazing, and i'm
uh, i'm revered as a god in sweden, and i really like that, so. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: was that before or after you named the album
<u>sweden</u>? 
<p>
 john: well they liked me-uh, i got my first mail
when they had heard rumors that there was going to be an album
called <u>sweden</u>, but they already liked me. but, uh, but
they went pretty nutty after <u>sweden</u> came out. i mean, there's
about ten people, these friends, that will show up at any show
in sweden, and they go completely ballistic. they're great! they're
just out of their minds. 
<p>
 kjhk: yeah, i'm, i'm on the inland list and i, i
saw the post about-- 
<p>
 john: join. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: yeah, being an honorary inductee into the inland
empire 
<p>
 john: the country? the whole country is all a member
of the inland empire. yeah 
<p>
 kjhk: wow. uh, how did you first start putting out
tapes? 
<p>
 john: uh, dennis callaci heard what i was doing and
asked me to make him a tape and i made a little, i just recorded
some songs and then i made a little mock-up sleeve, just to be
cute, ya know? and then the next time i saw him, he gave me ten
copies. i was very surprised, but kind of embarrassed, um, ya
know, 'cause i really didn't think-i didn't know what he was doing.
i heard he was doing some sort of a label but i was not hooked
into any underground at all. i had sort of given-up all aspirations
of being successful, which i recommend to anybody, right, that
if you want to, if you want to make a living at music, i would
say the first thing you gotta do is abandon that idea. just throw
it away, and forget it, and concentrate on other things, and set
other goals for yourself, because it's only when, you really,
if asked, would say, "no, i don't think i want that"
that you get anything. (laughter) and, i think if i had made a
big run at it, then i wouldn't even have any records out, but
as it was i was sort of ambiguous about the whole process for
all the way up through the first ajax album, and ya know, at that
point, then it gets kind of addictive, right? 
<p>
 kjhk: uh, i was gonna ask you something about recording. 
<p>
 john: uh-huh. 
<p>
 kjhk: how do you record? that's probably changed
through the. . .  
<p>
 john: yeah, uh, i'm still using the same machine,
uh that, that i made taboo vi with-you don't have that, do ya? 
<p>
 kjhk: uh, no, as a matter of fact i don't. 
<p>
 john: [whispering:] good, good, good, good, good.
[full voice:] no one should own that. it's not very good. 
<p>
 kjhk: i'm, i'm in the process of trying to accumulate
that. 
<p>
 john: well, you won't get it from me! (laughter) 
<p>
 [voice in the background, maybe a cassette tape]:
and dennis has put out. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: you won't be selling copies of that tonight? 
<p>
 john: no, no. no, i haven't, i don't think i've ever
sold copies of that. (laughter) maybe the first show we ever played
out of town in san francisco, but, but, no, it's not any good.
you don't want it. i mean, uh, but uh, although there will be
a sequel to it (laughter) but. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: taboo iv? 
<p>
 john: i'm big onto sequels these days. i'm, uh, i'm,
uh, ya know, rather than, uh, the album that's coming out is called
<u>full force galesburg</u> and it's not a sequel to anything,
and there's no, uh, a sequel to sweden was written, but probably
won't ever be released, um, it was written and recorded, but,
but i'm into the idea of, of making, making records that sort
of answer any questions raised by the predecessor. in the works
are answers to <u>taboo vi</u> and the second tape, uh, <u>the
hound chronicles</u>, so. the sequel to <u>the hound chronicles</u>
will just destroy the memory of <u>the hound chronicles</u>, by
uh. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: you don't like that tape? 
<p>
 john: well, it's good. it's all right. i mean, i
don't think i sing very well on it at all. i mean, i really think
i can sing now, ya know. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: that has some of my favorite mountain goats
songs on it. 
<p>
 john: so ya hit some good songs, but i really don't
think i was, i was the man to deliver them at that point, in my
life- 
<p>
 kjhk: right 
<p>
 john: i sound awfully--i didn't have much range,
and uh, ya know i think that like the, the new version of "going
to kansas" which uh, the vocals got a little buried, but
um, 
<p>
 kjhk: yeah, 
<p>
 john: but, and the new version of the song from the
first seven inch, uh, "alpha double negative: going to catalina"
that were on the last ajax album, are just vast improvements over
the originals, ya know, so, 'cause i'm a better singer now. 
<p>
 kjhk: will there be more of those- 
<p>
 john: i don't think so. 
<p>
 kjhk: in the sequels, will you be doing- 
<p>
 john: well, i'm not working with rachel any more
so there really wouldn't be any, any cause for recasting them.
i mean, it would be me doing them on a guitar again, only doing
it better, which, i mean, ya know, i don't think that's a valid
enough reason. i think recasting them with bass and second vocals
and everything was reason enough to redo them, but for me to do
them by myself wouldn't make sense. 
<p>
 kjhk: that was another question i was going to ask
you, is, what happened to the bright mountain choir? 
<p>
 john: well, i mean, they all moved. that was all
fairly early, uh, ya know, amy moved to new york, and sarah moved
way up into the hills of uh, uh, of los angeles, and ya know,
the bright mountain choir just barely even existed. actually,
all four of them only ever sang together with me once at a party.
right-- (laughter) 
<p>
 kjhk: really? 
<p>
 john:--there's various permutation of them appear.
sometimes it's rachel and amy. uh, on <u>the hound chronicles</u>
it's uh, sarah and rosanne mostly. um, so, uh, let's see here.
yeah, amy moved to new york and that was pretty much the end of
that. but, 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. 
<p>
 john: you won't find them listed, i don't think after
uh, after the first single. 
<p>
 kjhk: and, and rachel? 
<p>
 john: losin' it? 
<p>
 kjhk: is she, is she going to be on the new album? 
<p>
 john: no, no. 
<p>
 kjhk: neither of the new albums? 
<p>
 john: no, it's all boys this time. 
<p>
 kjhk: it's all boys. 
<p>
 john: it's all about boys! (laughter) no it's uh,
the new album's mostly me and uh, any collaboration was done through
the mail, um this time. i send stuff out to bob durkee 
<p>
 kjhk: why? 
<p>
 john: i recorded some of with bob durkee then i. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: and alistair galbraith recorded through the
mail again? 
<p>
 john: yeah, in new zealand and then he, uh, sent
them to bob. 
<p>
 kjhk: same way you guys did the seven inch? 
<p>
 john: yeah, yeah, it's a good way to do it. it's
really great, because that way, there's, there's zero pressure.
do we have to go somewhere or something? um, ok, um there's no
pressure on the person who's doing the addition. he has like,
even if he says, "i'll get it to you in a hurry" he
really has all the time in the world 'cause he's got the goods,
right, and uh, and besides which, he can sit around thinking about
it without you around. ya know, i think collaborating in the studio
with somebody would be hard because they'd be there watching you
and stuff, so. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: right, right, um, i was going to ask you about
cover songs. 
<p>
 john: uh-huh. 
<p>
 kjhk: you've covered songs, uh, by lionel richie,
hank williams, andrew loyd webber, ace of base, robert johnson,
uh, refrigerator, and you have a michael jackson cover coming
out on a compilation? 
<p>
 john: no, i know the compilation you're talking about,
but they, they asked and asked but i didn't do anything. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. 
<p>
 john: so i think they may release a song, that isn't
a michael jackson cover, or they might have taped me at sound
check, but uh, belgium and the netherlands, these people are nuts.
(laughter) and they're really into the tape thing. 
<p>
 kjhk: you might want to be careful what you're saying.
we are broadcast over the internet and there's an outside chance
they might be listening. 
<p>
 john: oh, they know they're nuts. they (laughter). . . it's
alright. . . (laughter). . . i think they enjoy the nuttiness.
and i like holland, pretty much better than most places in europe
anyway. the dutch are nice people and i think their language is
gorgeous. but they are nuts, and they know they're nuts, but uh,
but uh, yeah, they asked, wio is the name of the guy i think, 
<p>
 kjhk: right. 
<p>
 john: uh, who is doing the michael jackson cover. 
<p>
 kjhk: studio mussel, is it? 
<p>
'cause he's just awesome! i mean, it's like you bond with this
guy immediately, but, uh, i didn't ever get around to recording
anything. if he's got anything it would be from a sound check
in dordrecht [sp?] uh, 
<p>
 kjhk: okay, i was going to ask what all those artists
have in common? 
<p>
 john: well, you left out steely dan. 
<p>
 kjhk: did i? 
<p>
 john: yeah. 
<p>
 kjhk: when, when did you cover a steely dan- 
<p>
 john: on sweden. 
<p>
 kjhk: on sweden? 
<p>
 john: "fm" 
<p>
 kjhk: oh, that's a steely dan song? 
<p>
 john: yeah 
<p>
 kjhk: oh, that's a good song. 
<p>
 john: yeah, it's uh, it's uh, i mean the steely dan
song is a lot better, it's a lot more complicated, but uh, but
complicated doesn't mean better, but their version is really good.
it's from the sound track to a failed, failed, failed movie called
"fm" and uh, it's uh, yeah hard to get, except now you
can buy the greatest hits. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. uh, what do all those artists have in
common? 
<p>
 john: i dunno, i like their songs. 
<p>
 kjhk: really? (laughter) they're great songs? 
<p>
 john: ya know, i don't, i don't pick a cover because
of the artist who does it, as a general rule. i pick it 'cause
i like the song. 
<p>
 kjhk: so you're attracted to songs more than the
artists? 
<p>
 john: yeah, generally speaking. uh, no, not just
generally speaking. yes! i mean, i pick the song if i like the
song. 
<p>
 kjhk: would you say that list of people is representative
of your musical influences? 
<p>
 john: uuuuuuuuuuuum, i dunno, influence is such a
funny question, because i really believe strongly in influence,
ya know, and in picking out influence, and i think people who
claim not to be influenced are, are horrible liars but i think
probably are more fit to judge who influences me than i am. 'cause
there's what i really love listening to, um and then there's what
influences me and i don't know, i mean, i love to listen to joni
mitchel's <u>blue album</u>. i don't think i've written anything
that sounds even remotely like anything off of that record. and
i love propagandi. i've been listening to propagandi non-stop
for about a year. um, you won't hear any sign of propagandi (laughter)
or anything in anything i ever record, but uh, so i really don't
know who influences me. i listened to a lot of blues, when i was-probably
stuff i listened to when i was thirteen and fourteen, like blues
stuff and a lot of lou reed and david bowee. i think i get what
pompousness i have (laughter) from listening to david bowee. and
uh, lyrically, i think i'm a lot more influenced by writers than
by, then by musicians. 
<p>
 kjhk: by writers? 
<p>
 john: yeah. 
<p>
 kjhk: what kind of writers? 
<p>
 john: faulkner. i used to read a lot of. joan didion,
um, uh, catullus, petronius, who else? who else do i like? who's
coming? oh, there. 
<p>
 kjhk: come on in, joe.[?] do you have any questions? 
<p>
 joe [?]: uh, no. 
<p>
 kjhk: that you want to ask? 
<p>
 joe [?]: no, just coming by to say hi. 
<p>
 john: mostly joan didion, is a big influence. um,
i mean, although, i'm not as good as she is. but, uh, i'd like
to be as terse as she is. 
<p>
 kjhk: [pause] okay, um. 
<p>
 john: one starts being terse by cutting off sentences
abruptly. 
<p>
 kjhk: do you have any questions, joe? 
<p>
 joe [?]: no, no. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay, how do you, how do think these writers
influence uh, your songs? 
<p>
 john: okay, i can answer this. it's not very interesting,
and it might take a little while, but i can answer this. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. 
<p>
 john: um, writing--i can't stand. . . .[shuffling
in background] writing is about world of views, right? a story
is hardly even the point of any given novel or short story or
poem. what a short story or novel or poem or text, right, is about,
is about explaining how the universe seems, not necessarily to
the person writing but seems to voice that writes, to "the
hand that writes" is what roland brynes [sp????] would say,
right? so, um, so all you do when you write over and over again,
right? uh, endlessly, is express what you think the connections
are, how it all comes to have narrative, right, because, because
you gotta impose narrative on things-you touched my guitar! 
<p>
 kjhk: (laughter) 
<p>
 john: oh my god! oh my god! who gave you permission?
no, i'm kidding, uh, so, so when you write you express a world
view, right? you explain what you think the connections are. there
may or may not be any connections, right? and that's what makes
for tragedy, is, is trying to impose connections where there are
none; trying to state cause and effect where cause and effect
do not exist, right? cause and effect really can't be proven much
in human behavior, but, but, uh, but we always want to have it
that way, because if we can't have a narrative, then our lives
are going to seem pointless and then we're going to go on killing
sprees, right? (laughter) so we gotta have narrative, but there
isn't any narrative, and what any individual piece of work is
about, is the attempt to put order on chaos, right? comedy does
it in one way and tragedy does it in another. i think i work more
in tragedy, although tragedy doesn't necessarily mean it's not
funny. nor does comedy necessarily mean it's funny. um, what was
the question? 
<p>
 kjhk: (laughter) it was about writers influencing
your songs. 
<p>
 john: yeah, so, so right. joan didion, um is all
about the imposition of narrative, right? joan didion is, is all,
all her heroines usually, or heroes, occasionally come to a point
where they realize that the story that they're playing out in
their lives is not the story they're actually implicated in. right,
and uh, sometimes they catch a glimpse of what the other story
might be or become faintly cognizant of the fact that there is
no story, right? and that's the mode of high terror, right? ya
know, and uh, that's the point at which, uh, really there's a
lot at risk. if, if you don't feel it's ever been about anything,
that's the point at which you're going to sink into despair and
uh, and joan didion is really really acute in realizing that,
and so is eschulus, but in eschulus, everybody goes ahead and
dies. right, whereas in joan didion people go ahead and live because
it's twentieth century literature and that's one of the interesting
things about (laughter) twentieth century literature, is that
you don't have the option of just killing off all your characters. 
<p>
 kjhk: um, another question i was going to ask you
is, is that sound, on so many of your songs, before and after- 
<p>
 john: it's the guitar. (laughter) 
<p>
 kjhk: no, no, no, no. not that sound! 
<p>
 john: ha, ha, ha. 
<p>
 kjhk: you know the sound i'm talking about? 
<p>
 john: uh, the wheel-grind? 
<p>
 kjhk: yeah. 
<p>
 john: yeah. 
<p>
 kjhk: what is that? 
<p>
 john: that's wheel-grind. 
<p>
 kjhk: it's the tape you're recording on- 
<p>
 john: yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a very cheap tape
deck. well, it's not that cheap, but pretty cheap. and it's old,
and it's beat-up. and so, that's the sound that it makes and it
records itself making a sound whenever you record anything with
it. 
<p>
 joe [?]: i heard that particular box broke. 
<p>
 john: actually, ya know, it's the funniest box in
the world. because, uh, it breaks, then it's not broken, and i
don't fix it or anything. it like, ya know, it breaks and i try
and work with it and it just gets worse and i throw it in the
corner and i say "to hell with you" and don't record
anything for a long time, then i pull it out two months later
and it sounds fine, sometimes better than it sounded before. right
now it sounds fine, but i just bought a new tape-deck, so . . .  
<p>
 joe [?]: so the article in <u>magnet</u> was wrong. 
<p>
 john: uh, that article in <u>magnet</u> was attempting
to put a little more narrative on things then actually exists.
so actually, that plays right into the previous point, which is
a point you should not have gotten me onto, because i wrote my
whole, i wrote two theses about this. not one, but two. one in
english and one in classics and i'm big into the idea that we
all need narrative and we can't-none of us have it actually, unless
we're willing to abandon our american demand for honesty, right?
which i don't think is a bad thing, right? but, but if you want
to be honest, none of it makes sense, right? and if none of it
makes sense then you don't have any moral or ethical obligations,
right? and then, well, why don't you have everything you want?
and, and this leads us into some terrifying dark corners of the
mind, and that's just interesting and i'd like to say that these
are only things that i think about. my day to day life is mundane
and plain and i like it that way, ya know, and these are just
things to think about. i don't think they have any baring on what
you actually do in your life. you plant things and eat them and
you refrain from eating meat. 
<p>
 kjhk: refrain from what? 
<p>
 john: eating meat, because that's what evil people
do. 
<p>
 kjhk: that's funny that you mention that. i feel
the same way. 
<p>
 john: hey! my man! i'm glad. i was kind of hoping
you'd be offended but i'm glad you're not. 
<p>
 kjhk: no, as a matter of fact, no. i'm quite- 
<p>
 john: if there's any non-vegitarians out there. . . you're
on the road to hell. stop eating meat. thank you. 
<p>
 joe [?]: i'll see you there. 
<p>
 john: (laughter) [strums his guitar] so i would play
a smiths song now, but i don't know that song. 
<p>
 kjhk: (laughter) uh. . .  
<p>
 john: yeah, i don't know what to play. um, lemme
see here. . . [strums guitar]. . . (sigh) what key is that in?
[more strumming] i don't know if i actually know that one. that's
brand new. um, maybe i should probably play something i know,
um. . .  [starts to play the following song. . . ]<br>
 
<pre>
   [weekend in western illinois]
 
   the land's opening up like a blanket,
   and the dandelions spread themselves thickly out 
   along the fields, which are, evidently, endless. 
   and we are hotly in love with one another. 
   we've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats. 
   we are, for some reason, all the time, bleeding. 
   and we are friendless. 

   but we love these dogs that roll on the lawns here in galesburg, 
   because they seem to know something nobody else knows. 
   it is written on the smiles on their faces, 
   and it rings in their high young voices, 
   and we are burning up all of our choices 
   out here where the tall grass grows, up here in galesburg.
 
   the sky's opening up like an old wound, 
   and the rain on our bodies is warm tonight, 
   and the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder.
   and we can taste fresh blood in our mouths again:
   there is no chance of getting enough of it,
   and we tally up all our possessions, and we are going under.
 
   but we love these dogs that loll in the rain here in galesburg, 
   as the new season rocks them in its terrible arms.
   yeah they howl as though the world were ending,
   and we are watching the sky unwinding
   and some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form
   up here in galesburg.
</pre>
 
<p>
 kjhk: (clapping) 
<p>
 john: thanks. 
<p>
 kjhk: is that, is that the namesake of the <u>full
force galesburg</u>? 
<p>
 john: well, it's one of the songs. a lot of the songs,
all the songs on that one are somehow or another connected, sometimes
really loosely, uh, but, but it is the one song that mentions
it, yeah. it's called "weekend in western illinois." 
<p>
 kjhk: weekend in western illinois. 
<p>
 john: yeah. 
<p>
 kjhk: and galesburg is a town in western illinois? 
<p>
 john: it's a town near the, uh, iowa / illinois border. 
<p>
 kjhk: great. 
<p>
 john: i like border towns. i'm really fascinated
with border towns. if you get uh, the uh, one sheet from emperor
jones about the record, they talk a lot about brownesville texas,
which i've always been fascinated by. 
<p>
 kjhk: which is on the border of. . .  
<p>
 john: texas and mexico. 
<p>
 kjhk: mexico. 
<p>
 john: it's not on the border, but it's near enough
that it's a place you can hang out if you're waiting to hop borders
for some reason or another. 
<p>
 kjhk: why the fascination with borders? 
<p>
 john: uuuuh. because i'm roman catholic, ya know?
i mean, and it's all about borders. and again, everything's all
about borders. ya know, i mean you are the sum of what you won't
do, sort of. and so. . .  
<p>
 kjhk: okay. 
<p>
 john: you see how that plays into-that, that has
something to do with borders? i mean, your limitations are, are
what define you. 
<p>
 kjhk: right. 
<p>
 john: in a large, large way. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. 
<p>
 john: although in the nineties we're not supposed
to say that. we're supposed to say that we're all about potential,
but potential isn't anything. i mean, ya know, potential is i
think, a ridiculous concept, almost. ya know, it's, it's all about
"thou shalt nots" not about "thou shalts"
because there aren't any "thou shalts." right? there's
only what you can't do. and the rest of it is nebulous and undefined
and, and uh, and a lot of people see hope in that, and there is
hope in that, but, but it's not, um, oh i don't wanna, i don't
wanna, i haven't really thought the matter through there so i
probably shouldn't get started. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay. did you want to play another song? 
<p>
 john: sure. 
<p>
 kjhk: um. 
<p>
 john: [slides hand down fret board and strums a little]
i don't know what though. uhhhhh. . .  i know, i'll play a song
that, uh, are you into discothi-q at all? 
<p>
 kjhk: yeah. 
<p>
 john: okay, well, i wrote a song, and then they covered
it and i decided not to do it. right, um, that they could just
have it, right? and it's on their first album and it's called
"tulsa imperative."<br>
 
<pre>
   [tulsa imperative]
 
   your momma's failed wheat field 
   is a good place to lie down together. 
   three weeks deep into the guts of summer, 
   we sweat like hogs, and i felt light as a feather.

   i saw a disk-like object
   reflected in your eye. 
   and the noise grew louder 
   as we looked up to the sky.
 
   and the sleek silver body, 
   headlights along the side. 
   and the sleek silver body, 
   headlights all underneath.
 
   i remember the warm air, 
   blowing in our faces. 
   i remember the heat 
   running through me.
 
   there was no one worth telling. 
   there was nothing we could do. 
   and i was real quiet as i took the keys from the kitchen table. 
   i was looking right at you!
 
   and your hand brushed against mine 
   yeah, and it shook me inside. 
   all along the night sky 
   i watched our futures collide.
 
   and the car's new headlights 
   cut through the darkness. 
   as the oil dripped silently 
   to the pavement underneath.
 
   i can remember the warm air 
   burning our faces. 
   i remember the heat 
   running through me.
</pre>
<p>
 kjhk: [clapping] 
<p>
 john: thanks. 
<p>
 kjhk all right, thanks. did you. . . wanna play another
song? 
<p>
 john: sure, why not? um, but i don't have anything
prepared. so lemme think. see, then i have to think! so you should
talk while i think or something. 
<p>
 kjhk [and voices in background]: ok, well uh tullgrew
[?] is up next. why don't you bring andy in here? i think andy
has, has something to say, about next week's show. andy, come
in. talk about next week's show. andy, what, what do we have going
on next week, since we didn't get to anything today. 
<p>
 john: (laughter) 
<p>
 andy: the show is a couple hours! 
<p>
 kjhk: well, uh, has that been confirmed? 
<p>
 andy: no, no. 
<p>
 kjhk: well, scratch that from the record. 
<p>
 andy: (laughter) we're kidding. it will be two hours
in the realm of things, if you're in the same time warp. 
<p>
 kjhk: we'll be getting around to a lot of requests. 
<p>
 andy: let me start my, um, my um, lou barlow and
jason lowenstein, uh segments on "the lo-fi aesthetic"
next week. i've got them edited into five minute segments. 
<p>
 kjhk: and we'll be playing that throughout the next- 
<p>
 andy: start, start the first segment next week. 
<p>
 kjhk: and that'll last about four or five weeks? 
<p>
 andy: i think so, yes. 
<p>
 kjhk: k. 
<p>
 andy: and keep bringing us your tapes. i'm still
trying to organize another cover contest. 
<p>
 kjhk: all right! 
<p>
 andy: um, so uh, that'll be it. thanks john, for
coming in. 
<p>
 john: oh my god. talk for a minute. 
<p>
 kjhk: okay, what's going on in the community here?
john is uh, john is. . .  
<p>
 andy: skatepark benefit started at 3:30. 
<p>
 kjhk:. . . enthused about the uh, harey carey singing
the national anthem right now. 
<p>
 john [in background]: no! it was "take me out
to the ball game!" 
<p>
 kjhk: oh, i'm sorry. "take me out to the ball
game." uh, if we had the technologies, we'd, we'd put that
out over the air for you. uh, do we have a score, for the baseball
game out there? 
<p>
 [voices in backgroung]: it's an exhibition. they're
losing, they're losing to oakland. 
<p>
 andy: anyhow, today in the community, um, we've got,
um, the skate park benefit out at south park that started at um,
3:30. and um, the lawrence skate association. i highly encourage
you to go out there and support the uh, the. . .  
<p>
 john: the chicago cubs you should support! 
<p>
 kjhk: support the chicago cubs. so you're a big baseball
fan. 
<p>
 john: yeah, yeah my fix for this year are cubs and
mariners. 
<p>
 kjhk: cubs and mariners. 
<p>
 john: yeah. 
<p>
 kjhk: now you, you spent a lot of time in california.
 
<p>
 john: yeah, a long, long time. 
<p>
 kjhk: how did you become a cubs fan? 
<p>
 john: they're the greatest team in the history of
the game! what can i say? 
<p>
 kjhk: were you a cubs fan in california? 
<p>
 john: i was a cubs fan when i was in the forth grade
and i read in my <u>weekly reader</u>, there was a story, ya know,
a little-you remember <u>my weekly reader</u>, the little-it was
a newspaper. 
<p>
 andy: yeah, i remember. 
<p>
 john: it's like the teacher-you had to learn to read
the newspaper, ya know, so you got used to the idea, and uh, and
uh, there was an article about a guy-you know this story or no? 
<p>
 khjk: no. 
<p>
 john: well, there was an article 
<p>
 [at this point my cassette ran out of tape. the guys
at kjhk told me that there were a few more minutes left, and they
said they'd try and get me a complete tape. whenever i get that,
i'll send along the rest of the transcription. -j.m.]<br>
