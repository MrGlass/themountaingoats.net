<h3><a name="white">white box</a></h3>
well I did it now
oh I did it now
the box said do not open under pain of death
it had my initials there where
I signed my initials there on it
on that white box
I saw initials there
do not open under pain of death
but I opened anyway
I died anyway
I died anyway
so I come back to stay
come back to stay
lord knows I love you anyway
I love you anyway
