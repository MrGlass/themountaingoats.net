lyrics file for taboo vi: the homecoming 

<h3><a name="freud"> 
running away with what freud said 
</a></h3> 

Big city, wide corner, 
New flowers, cold comfort. 
56 farenheit early in the morning. 
Buses passing by black smoke in their wake. 
Bit surprises, a lot of big surprises 
Bones ringing, running away with what Freud said. 

New morning, world breathing, 
Far, far from home
Big ringing in the bones
Whose bones are these? God please.
Feeling the pumping, feeling the fresh blood pump inside
City's living, the city's truly living 
What's the difference? Running away with what freud said. 



<h3><a name="cobra"> 
ice cream, cobra man 
</a></h3> 

I have a hand disfigured by snakebite.
I have a couple of things that I really like
and I am heading your way all the time.

I'm going to move all my vital organs
to someplace outside my body.
The wiring is something you would not believe.

I feel no pain as I float across your ceiling, and I --
I have no shame.
I am in a thousand rooms all at the same time.
Yeah and I have a glass
filled with water and light, and I feel good tonight.
I am climbing up this mountain.
You can watch me. You can watch me.



<h3><a name="move"> 
move (chicago 196?) 
</a></h3> 

you leave, you're gonna get athletes foot. 
athletes foot, when you leave. oooh. 
athletes foot, athletes foot, 
athletes foot, when you leave. 
oooh, oooh. 

[voices in background, giggling] 

if you leave, you're gonna get athletes foot. 
athletes foot, when you leave. 
oooh. athletes foot, athletes foot. 
athletes foot, when you leave. oooh. 


<h3><a name="magic"> 
this magic moment * 
</a></h3> 

this magic moment, 
so different and so new. 
like any other. 
until I kissed you. 
and then it happened. 
it took me by surprise. 
I knew you felt it too, 
by the look in you eyes. 

sweeter than wine, 
softer than a summer night. 
the feeling I had inside, 
whenever I held you tight. 

this magic moment, 
with your lips so close to mine, 
will last forever, 
forever till the end of time. 
whoaaa, whoaaa, whoaaa. 

[repeat last two stanzas with 4 extra "whoaaa"s] 


<h3><a name="dogs"> 
don't take the dogs away 
</a></h3> 

don't take the dogs away. 
don't take that dog away from me. 
don't take the dogs away. 
don't take the dogs away from me. 

you do this every time. 
you do this every time I swear. 
you do this every time. 
you do this every time I learned. 

just look around. 
just look around the house we're in. 
what should I say to you? 
where do you want me to begin? 

don't take the dogs away. 
don't take the dogs away from me. 
don't take the dogs away. 
don't take the dogs away from me. 



<h3><a name="privative"> 
one winter at point alpha privative 
</a></h3> 

what the hell kind of deal is it here anyway? 
how much does it cost and how long can you stay? 
should we dance? should we sing? should we curse? should we pray? 
do I have to hang on every single word that you say? 
every hour, every minute, every second of the day 
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 

what the hell's going on at the end of the debate?
there's nothing you can do but ???? 
??????????????????????????? 
could we sit down over there? could we sit down any place?
can you feel the spirit moving? can you feel god's grace? 
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 

ever since I've married you I've wondered what it means.
that every single shirt I owned was ????? 
every single piece of clothing, every last pair of jeans, 
all the reds, all the whites, all the yellows, all the greens. 
I'm sure that there's a reason all of this is happening. 
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 


<h3><a name="solomon"> 
solomon revisited 
</a></h3> 

you say you came to see me, 
because you had nothing else to do, 
but I've got a radio. 
you say you'd thought you'd stop on by 
and let me have a look at you, 
but I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 

you say you brought some photographs, 
but I don't care to see them, 
'cause I've got a radio. 

you say this place must get dull sometimes, 
but that's not the way I see it. 
'cause I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got me a radio. 
I've got a radio. 

you see these frogs are treacherous, 
but how long has it been since you've seen my feet? 
you see, I've got a radio. 
you warned me about all sorts of things, 
but that's not the sort of warning that I need. 
you see, I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 
I've got a radio. 


<h3><a name="alaska"> 
going to alaska 
</a></h3> 

The jacaranda are wet with color, 
and the heat is a great paint brush, lending color to our lives, 
and to the air, and to out faces; but I'm going to Alaska 
where there's snow to suck the sound out from the air. 

Up, yes, in the branches, 
the purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;
there is meanining in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them traces 
of last year, but then they hadn't grown so strong, 
and their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables.
thick and alive with alien electricity, and I am going to Alaska,
where you can go blind just by looking at the ground,
where fat is eaten by itself
just to keep the body warm.

Because from where we are now, it seems, really,
that everything is growing in a thousand different ways;
that the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives
who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise
to what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise?
I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you,
but they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them,
then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska.
They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes.



<h3><a name="lonesome"> 
(note: woman speaking spanish (translating the song) in the background)
I'm so lonesome I could cry ** 
</a></h3> 

hear that lonesome whipporwill 
he sounds too blue to fly. 
the midnight train is riding low. 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 

(sniff) 

I've never seen a night so long, 
when time goes crawling by. 
the moon just went behind the clouds 
to hide its face and die. 

(sniff) 

(sniff) 

did you ever see a robbin weep 
when leaves begin to die? 
that means he's lost the will to live. 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 

the sign has come, a falling star. 
like love, a purple sky. 
they'll never wonder where you are. 
I'm so lonesome I could cry. 

(sniff) 

I'm so lonesome I could cry. 


<h3><a name="eleven"> 
eleven bands *** 
</a></h3> 

follow the grass up the mountain up the foot of the mountain. 
follow the twisting branches. 
when you look at them 
remember that they are alive, growing still. 
see their colors lighten, as you climb. 
watch the sunlight catch them and reflect them. 
it reflects them everywhere. 

one of these paths leading up the nameless mountain 
was the one that told you somthing once. 
but you will not find it here. 
it has shriveled up and pickeled off the mountain. 
like a dying vine. 
one these things take on their weightlessness, 
the structure comes apart. 

how do the trees grow in this weather? 
it is freezing cold. 
take the map on up the mountain side. 
and all the sounds from far and wide will leave you suddenly. 
and sugar winds come through the clouds.
