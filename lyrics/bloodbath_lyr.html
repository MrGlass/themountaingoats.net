Lyrics file for Moon Colony Bloodbath

<h3> <a name="surrounded">surrounded</a> </h3>
pale white moon shines down on colorado
hide my dirty secrets
down here in the shadows
where the quaking aspens
tremble in the snow
haul me up the hillside
hold me high and let me go
let me fall down through my own roof like a meteorite
let the world and all its wonders leave me to my toys tonight
and my ninty-six inch television screen
let me die.
let me die surrounded by machines.

high winds knocked the power out last night
but I've got my own supply here
all my windows blaze with light
and the light spills through the windows to the empty plain below
finds nothing but some trees and six fresh feet of snow
and I find a broadcast station that's signed off for the night
and the static floods the speakers in glorious black and white
on my ninty-six inch television screen
let me die.
let me die surrounded by machines.



<h3> <a name="lucifer">lucifer rising</a> </h3>
call me the running man
call me alachua county bill
call me dripping water underneath the phospher still
call me john the ripper tearing at your skin
one day I'll pay for this,
for now just let me in.

it's a straight walk home.
it's a straight walk home.
it's a straight walk home.
straight walk home.
through the generation fields
and the ventilation dome.
body after body, alone.

nix your dirty water
forget your resource management skills
I crawl starving down sloping colorado hills
call me john the ripper tearing at your skin
one day I'll pay for this,
for now just let me in.

it's a straight walk home.
straight walk home.
straight walk home.
straight walk home.
through the generation fields
and the ventilation dome.
body after body, alone.



<h3> <a name="satori">satori in denver</a> </h3>
speed down 24 toward the city for supplies,
technically out of bounds
roll my window down hear my tires sing to the asphalt
and drink in the highway sounds.

oh solitude, friend of the friendless
light in the dark night coming on
grab what I want without saying a word
and drive thorugh the dark 'til dawn.

tracklights blur together, anklet buzzing on my leg
thinking up lies to tell.
and this may be the time I get banished from the palace
to seek out some smaller cell.

oh solitude, friend of the friendless
light in the dark night coming on
grab what I want without saying a word
and ride through the dark 'til dawn.



<h3> <a name="scorpio">scorpio rising</a> </h3>
out in the desert in the last light of day
we search for the fooprints of bobby beausoleil
and there in the desert past the LA county line
bobby buried the canister in the middle of the night

I'm not alright
I'm not alright
I'm really not up for the fight.

slow it down.
slow it down, down down.
slow it down.
slow it down, down down.

the gears grind on as the van accelerates
some things buried deep need to stay that way.

I'm not alright
I'm not alright
I'm really not up for the fight.

slow it down.
slow it down, down down.
slow it down.
slow it down, down down.
slow it down.
slow it down, down down.
slow it down.
slow it down, down down.



<h3> <a name="suddenoak">sudden oak death</a> </h3>
lose a little feeling in my fingers
gain an edge of panic in my face
search for some sign to tell me just how long I've been here
overturn the place

feels like each time my efforts fail
the whole hillsides disapprove
feel like a man whose veins have frozen overnight
lying there, trying to move

yeah when the crack sounds in the wood
you will know that I'm down for good.
when the crack sounds in the wood
you will know, old friend, that I'm down for good.

I want to try to stand my ground,
dig my heels into the hills.
hope someone will come to right my balance
no one will.
feels like when I try to stretch my legs
everyone around me's trying too
so ready just to fall down, just to fall down
and to stay down.
I don't wanna spoil the view.

yeah when the crack sounds in the wood
you will know that I'm down for good.
when the crack sounds in the wood
you will know, old friend, that I'm down for good.



<h3> <a name="columns">columns pillars steps</a> </h3>
try to lie.
try to lie still.
and just give in to uncontrollable will.

don't say a word or look me in the eyes.
don't try to comfort me.
i'm unconsolable still.
cruisin' all night.
i'm still cruisin' all night.
i'm still cruisin' all night.
still cruisin' all night.

I saw you in DCU
you're with somebody new
I know how you are.
it's always a quarter to two.

still cruisin' all night.
still cruisin' all night.
still cruisin' all night.
still cruisin' all night.



<h3> <a name="emerging">emerging</a> </h3>
I am hungry, but I'm not cold.
I'm starving, but the suit keeps me warm.
and the light hits me full in the face
as I assume my new and dreadful form.

kick an incubator open
and like a flower in bloom
sustenance, blessed sustenance
oozing from the tomb

I know that sleeping bodies hide sweet things inside.

and in the ever present light
and in my ever growing needs
if a man should crest the ridge,
he's going to have to watch me feed.

but no one's ever gonna come
and nobody's gonna know
I will sail home again concealed among the upright walking men
to know that sleeping bodies hide sweet things inside.
