<h3><a name="milk"> 
pure milk 
</h3> 

the moon's full, and the sky is bright, 
and so you and me are gonna get drunk tonight. 
we're gonna steal some tractors and head on into town, 
find the main strip and start mowing them down. 

don't come to the window till you're sure it's me. 
don't ignore the obvious. take a deep breath. 
put your hand on the god damn radio. 
put your hand on the god damn radio. 

fields are full of spirits, but no one cares at all. 
a light above you flickers when you hear me call. 
and I'm shaking when I see you there cause I don't know what it means. 
but the ground is looking dry tonight and bursting near the seams. 

so don't come to the window till you're sure it's me. 
don't ignore the obvious. take a deep breath. 
put your hand on the god damn radio. 
put your hand on the god damn radio, yeah. 

<h3><a name="ice"> 
ice blue 
</h3> 

the sky was pale. the day was gloomy! 
boy your eyes burned through me. 

thought that I knew what colors were. 
ha ha ha! ha ha ha! 

thought that I knew what colors were, 
before I saw you... 
ice blue! 


<h3><a name="water"> 
water song II 
</h3> 

they'll be singing out loud 
when the water goes through the crowd. 
they'll be howling for you 
when the waves come crashing through. 

I brought my friend. here he comes, 
splashing, gurgling for you. 
now the water runs through the streets unimpaired, 
crashing through. 

they'll be saying your name, 
every voice different, every word the same. 
they'll be holding you up 
too close to the sun, 
but I will make them stop. 

I brought my friend. here he comes, 
splashing, gurgling for you. 
and now the water runs through the streets unimpaired, 
rushing through. 

still ??? singing, go stand in the light. 
when my friend gets here he will set things right. 
they'll be singing for one thing and they'll get this instead. 
let them come and get me, let them strike me dead. 

I brought my friend. here he comes, 
splashing, gurgling for you. 
now the water runs through the streets unimpaired, 
rushing through. 

I brought my friend. here he comes, 
splashing, gurgling for you. 
and now the water runs through the streets unimpaired, 
rushing through. 


<h3><a name="sun"> 
sun song 
</h3> 

the sun was a yellow eye in a blue face 
when you came over to my place 
and you said how things looked dead around here. 
well that's alright if things look dead around here, 
cause it's only a little while longer that things are gonna look dead around here. 

and there are certain gardening skills that you don't have yet. 
and there are certain gardening skills that you'll never learn. 
how to leave alone what's doing fine, 
how to mulch what's dying on the vine. 
there are certain gardening secrets you don't know. 

you said the soil looked nitrogen poor, 
well, don't you worry about the soil looking nitrogen poor. 
I think that's my problem if the soil is nitrogen poor. 
but for myself it looks kind of nitrogen rich. 

and there are certain gardening secrets you don't have yet. 
and there are certain gardening skills that you'll never learn. 
how to leave alone what's doing fine, 
how to mulch what's dying on the vine. 
there are certain gardening secrets you don't know. 


<h3><a name="japan"> 
going to japan 
</h3> 

there's a north wind coming in 
and there's a west wind coming in 
and there's an east wind coming in 
and there's a strong wind blowing in from the south 
and there's a sweet metallic taste in my mouth. 
there's a dead feeling lingering over the wind. 

and there's a one-way ticket in my hot little hand 
and I'm kissing your eyelids and I'm going to japan. 

there's life and liberty on my tongue 
and there's a dead silence where the wind-chimes hung 
and on some mountain somewhere in the world it's snowing 
but here in the fields there's not a thing growing. 
maybe next year, ya know, there is a way of knowing. 
there's wind coming in from all directions. 
there's a coat on my shoulders--midnight connections. 

and I'm kissing you and leaving you behind in the sand. 
I'm holding you a while then I'm going to japan. 


<h3><a name="stone"> 
are you cleaning off the stone? 
</h3> 

I'd like to begin by saying that I saw you coming, 
but that would be a lie. 
I'd like to say that I can hear your voice, 
but I couldn't mean 'hear' in the accepted sense of the word. 

are you cleaning off the stone? 
that's a sweet thing to do. 
are you cleaning off the stone? 
that's sweet of you. 

they tell me your hair's gotten much, much longer. 
I bet it looks nice. 
they tell me your eyes are the same color as they always were. 
that kind of information just floors me. 

are you cleaning off the stone? 
that's a sweet thing to do. 
are you cleaning off the stone? 
that's sweet of you. 

are you cleaning off the stone? 
that's a sweet thing to do. 
are you cleaning off the stone? 
that's sweet of you. 



<h3><a name="stomp"> 
the hot garden stomp 
</h3> 

the room was unbearably hot.
flowering plant that hung from the radiator pipe. 
it was dripping sweat from its rapidly fading petals. 
and to the humming world in which I was living, 

a crescendoing stepping sound came in. 
heard you stepping over three weeks' worth of newspapers 
piled up outside the door. 

I hear you knocking. 
come in. 
turn on the radio. 
turn up the volume. 

you sat down in the same place where you used to sit. 
it brought back a memory or two. 
I may not know much any more, but I remember you. 

you were quiet for a while, and that was nice. 
then you came along with your questions, 
always questions. 
I don't have any answers to those particular questions. 

I hear you talking. 
shut up! 
turn on the radio. 
turn up the volume. 


<h3><a name="hymn"> 
love hymn to aphrodite 
</h3> 

[spoken:] the actual date is the 17th of april. love hymn to aphrodite. 

the sunset gets a little longer every night 
and it's no good but I feel alright. 
the sky turns orange and the colors start swirling. 
you float downstairs, your body spinning 
in perfect circles. 
it's the 18th of july, what what are you doing? 



<h3> <a name="beachhouse">
beach house 
</h3> 
I get letters telling me since I moved away 
you've taken to hanging out on that rock about a mile from shore 
given what I know about that rock mainly that it's populated by seals 
I strongly suggest to you that you not hang out there anymore 
'cause the seal is a wily and a vicious creature 
and the seal will bite you if you give him half a chance 
yeah the seal has a mind set on violence 
and the seal is the sworn enemy of man 

now when I say that the seal is vicious I use the term advisedly 
according to webster's 9th new collegiate definition 4b. 

which states that vicious means marked by ferocity 
and offers as a synonym...savage 
'cause the seal is a vicious and a wily creature 
and the seal has a mind full of evil designs 
and the seal will harm you and laugh about it 
yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with 
yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with 


<h3> <a name="howard">
hello there howard 
</h3> 
the guy on my right is new 
and he says he feels kinda sad and his hands are cold 
and he refuses the dice 
so I pick 'em up myself.
I let 'em roll. 

and the little white spots gleam like stars 
and the guy on my right gets a look at the stickman 
and he begins to sense where it is that we are 
and the table's hot 
but so am I 
and I grab the bones and I let 'em fly. 
so come 2 come 3 come 4 come 5 come 6 come 7 come 9 
it doesn't matter to me now 
'cause I've got all kinds of time.


<h3> <a name="norwalk">
going to norwalk 
</h3> 
at one thirty on a thursday night 
I saw a pair of raccoons heading to the gutter 
they stopped at the storm drain 
their tails hung down and out of sight 
they looked up at me 
their eyes were shining 
I thought of you 

and I can't stand the way the moon expands and fills out  
the corners of your california sky 
I can't stand it 

the old buildings stood tall against the sky 
the windows had old sheets hanging over them doubling as curtains 
and the silhouettes moving in the bright lights behind the curtains 
looked like you 
I stopped moving momentarily 

the world will 
stand still on nights like these 
without any kind of warning 
and I can't stand it. 


<h3> <a name="cherries">
fresh cherries in trinidad 
</h3> 
when I woke up on saturday and you came in 
you brought the sunlight in 
I felt sleep slipping away from me 
I feel things occasionally like this 
fresh cherries 
hanging from your fingers 

when the water on the window let the sunlight through 
and I got a good look at you 
standing above me bright and tall 
there are no words for it 
there are no words at all 
I saw 
fresh cherries 
hanging from your fingers 


<h3> <a name="feed">
feed this end 
</h3> 
ok 
come here you 
what? 
I want you to be my love slave 
yes master oh you ??? 
who me? 
it goes both ways 
it does? 
mmm yeah. 
I'm gonna be your love slave? 
uh-huh 

stood near the cage of the prize-fighting cock 
the sun cut through the clouds but the air pressure dropped 
and I touched your hair for the very first time 
I have that moment with me now 
it's all mine 
and you 
showed me a thing or two about power in its purest form 

a few minutes later you went back inside 
and I stood near the clothesline where strips of beef dried 
hanging in the noon-day sun 
flies were buzzing nearby 
and then your face in the window caught my eye 
and you 
showed me a thing or two about power in its purest form 

things don't look much different now from where I stand 
looking for you with camera in hand 
someone's gone away 
and someone's gotten taller 
but the world stopped turning and the universe is much smaller 
since you 
showed me a thing or two about power in its purest form 
yeah you 
showed me a thing or two about power in its purest form 


<h3> <a name="151">
15-1 
</h3> 
if I had a car and you were riding in it 
I'd show you what my car could do 
I head east down highway fifteen and see the starlight 
shower over you 
gas fumes rising from the blacktop 
cheap hotels with flashing signs 
just an old sweet song made new 
and oozing through the pines 

if I had thirty dollars and I could make time stop 
and the moon was high up above 
and moon beams fell like sweet cream 
and the night air would carry our dark dreams 

gas fumes off the highway  
neon flashing everwhere 
just an old sweet song made new by your body 
and desert flowers blooming in the thick night air 


<h3> <a name="dress">
thanks for the dress 
</h3> 
...he'll still be like 
...it's so good. she's 
...tell ya about personal testimony 
...please keep feeding us 

the young sun 
the old story forming 
hasn't been the same 
since dad came by this morning 
did you see the way mom's looking at us 
mark it well 

your eyes meet mine 
when we hear her call 
the strange birds in the yard 
are perched above the symbols that she painted on the garden wall 
did you see the way mom's looking at us 
did you see the way mom's looking at us 
don't say anything 


<h3> <a name="sunday">
tell me on a sunday 
</h3> 
don't write a letter 
when you want to leave 
don't call me at three a.m. from your friend's apartment 

I'd like to choose 
how I hear the news 
take me to a park that's covered with trees 
tell me on a sunday please 

let me down easy no big song and dance 
no long faces no long looks just deep conversation 
I know the way 
I want to spend that day 

take me to the zoo 
with big chimpanzees 
tell me on a sunday please 

don't want to know who's to blame 
won't help knowing 
I don't want to fight day and night 
it's bad enough that you're going 
don't leave in silence - no words at all 
don't get mad and slam the door 
it's no way to end this 

I know how I 
want you to say goodbye 
by the circus tent with a big trapeeze 
tell me on a sunday please 

I don't want to fight day and night 
it's bad enough that you're going 
don't leave in silence - no words at all 
don't get mad and slam the door 
it's no way to end this 

I know how I 
want you to say goodbye 

don't run off in the pouring rain 
don't call me as they call your plane 
take the hurt out of all the pain 

take me to a park that's covered with trees 
tell me on a sunday please
