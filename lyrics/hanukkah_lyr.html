<h3>
<a name="pie">Give Your Mom Some Pie For Hannukah</a></h3>

Won't you give your mom some pie for Hanukah?
Your mom would like some pie
With a nice sugar crust
And some cheese on the side
Please don't let another Hanukah go by
Without giving your mom a slice of pie

Is this the gratitude your mom gets?
You come around here with your little shiksa wife
But you can't be bothered to bring a pie with you
What's in your life?

Won't you put away your Tortoise remix records?
Get out your Steve & Eydie box set
Bring a lovely slice of pie down to mom's house right
now
And have the best Hanukah yet

Won't you give your mom some pie for Hanukah?
Your mom would like some pie
With a nice sugar crust
And some cheese on the side
Don't let another Hanukah go by
Without giving your mom a slice of pie

Hava nagila
Hava nagila
Yeah!
