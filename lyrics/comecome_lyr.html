<h3><a name="collapsing">collapsing stars</a></h3>
when we hid out behind the risers at he high school,
working bitter calculations with a slide rule.
the grim particulars of poisoning the swimming pool,
well you looked me in the eye,
ready to die.

we were becoming what we are,
collapsing stars.

when we chewed up baby aspirin like bubble gum,
til our hearts were beating as deep and rich as kettle drums
we knew if we waited long enough the change would come.
and then the day did come and at last
hold tight.
hold fast.

catch lightning in a jar,
collapsing stars.

I told you to load up on provisions,
because we wouldn't be back for a while.
pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
turn toward the camera and smile, smile, smile.

when we ditched the plan to poison all our enemies,
stuffed our weapons in a clearing, and covered them with leaves,
we are going to come rejoicing bringing in the sheaves
one day, and we are on our way.

you can look,
but you won't find
another love like ours,
collapsing stars.



<h3><a name="highdoses2">high doses #2</a></h3>
we all woke up that morning,
claw marks on our little faces.
the dull thud from the treetops
the echo in the hollow places
rose up high and lonely
wringing my hands, grinding my teeth
all the triumph overhead
all the disaster underneath

spat out my morning prayers
desperate pleas and viscious lies.
felt the sunlight thugh the grating,
coverered up my eyes.
woke up feeling awful
shook my head to drive the ghosts way
this is just a flesh wound
and it will clear up any day.
but the present i got planned for you pricks,
is gonna be a little harder to fix.
thank god
for small favors
in high doses.

heard the voices through the air vents
listen to them squeal
the great big world is out there
the hidden one beneath my heel
called up my sister in reseda,
left a message at the tone.
all the points where contact fails us
all of the dead spots in the zone

and the acid in my throat
every time i try to talk
the songs that keep me up at night
standing on that solid rock
rose up high and dry and lonely
stumbled coming out the gate
this is just a paper cut
and it will scab over just you wait.
but the cuts that i'll shortly being dealing out,
are gonna give you something to cry about.

thank god
for small favors
in high doses.



<h3><a name="aliens">the day the aliens came</a></h3>
hey, mr. hughes and mr. vanderslice, uh this is a new song 
i'm really excited aboo, about, and uh and so since i wrote
it on my old cort guitar instead of the new one i, i want to
play on that just for purposes of 'cause i've been writing
it and so forth so that's why it sounds a little beat up and
flat and everything, 'cause these strings are old and everything,
so sorry about that, uh, it's i-, it's in A. i think i'm tuned to an A.
it should be called hawaiian feeling, but it probably can't be
called that.  um, ok, right. alright.

I will wake up at six a.m. again.
and I will find my way to the front door
like a soldier crawling through the smoking carnage.
smoldering bodies at my feet,
I'd love to stick around, but I've got someone to meet.
and I will put my best foot forward.
and I'll thank god I made it out of there
on the day when my new friends come.

I will present myself in my nice white tuxedo jacket.
and I will look out at the day through my dark sunglasses,
and take in the scene.
the house behind me and the people in it
will all go up like steam in just a minute.
there's gonna be a redefining of some borders,
and I will receive my orders
on the day when my new friends come.

the rooftops and the sidewalks
will all melt like pastic.
and oh friends, old friends, dear friends,
I'm gonna look fantastic.

there won't be any reason left to cry
'cause there won't be any people left to cry for.
my memory's gonna vaporize itself.
and my italian shoes, well, they will be to die for.
I believe I can fly.
might you look up at me and wave goodbye
on the day when my new friends come?
