<a name="nova"><h3>nova scotia</h3></a>
coming in off nova scotia
yellow sun in the blue sky
all those cat-tails in the wind
I got something in my eye

listen, everything I love I will devour
and bury the bones down in the snow
put me in a beat up el camino
just let me go, just let me go

<a name="attention"><h3>attention all pickpockets</h3></a>
in comes you, not the same person I knew
Looking roughly the same but something hungry getting restless in your brain

hey hey hey hey hey

so there I go, not the same person that you used to know
peeking through the fisheye lens at you

and the coronet blows
where the oleander grows
and us two, not the same people that our old friends knew

and so down the street, you head, in the high summer heat
white long sleeved Oxford pushed up to just before your elbows

black pumps and a medium length black skirt
eating a path through the dark damp Earth
I hope they've got plenty of money where you're going

and the coronet blows
where the oleander grows
and us two, not the same people that our old friends knew

<h6>Thanks to Christopher MacMurray for transcribing this</h6>
