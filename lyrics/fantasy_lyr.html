<h3><a name="planets">
i hear the planets 
</h3>

they'll come at you with all manner of astronomical sorcery.
they'll be pulling you back as you make your way up the highway.
you can tell 'em from me that they don't know anything about anything
they can just stand back with their amateur interpretations of 
    scripture.

i hear the planets singing our names
and i see you making your way up the hillside
i can see the pacific from here
the waves are calm and the water's clear
i hear the planets singing our names.

when you're with me you'll see their smooth forms taking shape in the 
   sky
and i will hold your hand and move my thumb around there in your palm
and the constellations will all display their bright colours up above 
   and around us
and many are the plans in the human heart
for the purposes of yahweh they stand firm

(chorus)
