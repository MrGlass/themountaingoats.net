lyrics file for devil in the shortwave
<pre> <h3><a name="crows">crows </h3>
well i went way out North Carolina way 
to that old graveyard where my great grandmother lay 
and the day was bright and i hadn't slept all night 
and they sold the place to some guys who were building graduate student housing
no one raised any objections 
they were knocking the headstones down
and the sun was high when i rolled into town
stood by a nameless hole in the ground
the air was sweet and hot
maybe it was the right grave,
maybe not
but the crows crows crows 
rose, rose, rose from the grave
Yeah the crows crows crows 
rose, rose, rose from the grave



<h3><a name="genesis"> genesis 19:1-2 </h3>
the girl who'd been haunting your dreams all your life
the butcher from brooklyn, the butcher's wife
the girl who kissed you in the seventh grade
her and all the others lined up behind the gate
the two angels came to sodom in the evening
when the sun up in the sky was bleeding all over you

and you had your camera
and you had your felt tip
and you had some money 
and you had everything you needed
the two angels came to sodom in the evening
we saw you coming up the boulevard
the two angels came to sodom in the evening
when the sun was bleeding all over you



<h3><a name="yoga"> yoga </h3>
we had our passports out and the kits to fix 'em up with.
and the hurricane lamp cast our shadows on the ceiling.
i watched 'em box with one another like punch and judy.
it was dangerous and delightful.
it was that kind of feeling
when you said you were sure there was nothing standing in our way.
and the lie ran off and hid itself in the alleys all around bombay.

i saw you knock the lamp over while reaching for the scissors
and i wondered how we'd ever get by without it.
and you fell into my arms, sweet and gentle.
poison in the water.
little doubt about it.
and you said that one of us would be all alone someday.
and the truth of it echoed inexhaustably all across bombay.
la la la.



<h3><a name="town"> dirty old town </h3>
<h6>this is an ewan mccoll song</h6>


<h3><a name="commandante"> commandante </h3>
i'm gonna drink more whiskey than brendan behan.
and i'm gonna send my belongings all to tripoli.
and i'm gonna ride home to california
with a banjo on my knee.

i'm never gonna turn off the television.
i'm just gonna let it run all night.
i'm gonna plant root vegetables out in the backyard
and come summer i am going to treat you right.

so put on your chairman mao coat
and let me clear my throat.
let's turn this whole town upside-down
and shake it 'til the coins come falling out of its pockets,
yeah put on your che guevara pin
call the troops on in
we're gonna sail through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets.

i got a great big secret written down somewhere.
i got a rosary to protect us both from harm.
i got a storage locker full of cow figurines
and a laundry list of grievances longer than my arm.
and i am never going back to cincinnati.
all those bridges have burned down to the ground.
i got the jet pack strapped to my back
and i am waiting for you to come around.

yeah, put on your chairman mao coat
and let me clear my throat.
let's turn this whole place upside-down
and shake it 'til the coins come dropping out of its pockets.
yeah put on your che guevara pin
call the troops on in.
we're gonna sink through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets.
