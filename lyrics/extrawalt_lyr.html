lyrics file for extra walt! 

<h3>gravedigger</h3> 

the pumpkins grew in neat rows 
he waltzed toward the center of the field 
steady as show goes 
and blue heavens built wishing wells 
brightening the patch 
fattening the pumpkins in their orange shells 
we turned right by the smooth orange big one 
the wrong way. 

we tapped the pumpkins with our thumbs 
and now how ya wait a year or so 
nothing comes 
it was like that empty bottles washed green by rain 
having to lose ?here? 
no reason to complain 
we turned right by the smooth orange fat one 
the wrong way. 

tell me a secret 
what does it matter 
override the red clouds 
hanging on the otherwise ?grave? sky 
and then little raindrops like tiny knives 
and I turned to you and the field comes alive 
we took a smooth turn around the fattest pumpkin they had 
the wrong way.
