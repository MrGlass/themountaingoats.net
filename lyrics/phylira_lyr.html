<h3><a name="snow">
third snow song</a>
</h3>

in january i took a short walk
down to the broadway bridge
two and a half blocks
when you scrape the ice away
you can read the bridge dedication
i can feel the cold air coming in through my teeth
i saw the bridge
i saw the water underneath
that's a whole lotta water
that's a whole lotta water

i took out the key that i'd forgotten the function of
twisted it from the keyring as the bridge loomed above
i hammered it against the ice
i hammered it against the ice

<h3>
<a name="monkey">
the monkey song</a>
</h3>
cool air falls through the venetian blinds and
the planets in the heavens are perfectly aligned
i take in my surroundings
i memorize them all
the scuff marks on the stone floor,
the powder burns on the eastern wall

there's a monkey in the basement
how did the monkey get there?
there's a monkey in the basement
where did the monkey come from?
where did the monkey come from?
where did the monkey come from?

the animal noises you used to make
the andalusian coral snake
all hail when standing beside this room
and the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom

there's a monkey in the basement
where did the monkey come from?
there's a monkey in the basement
how did the monkey get there?
how did the monkey get there?
how did the monkey get there?

<h3>
<a name="strings">
love cuts the strings</a>

you can find out how to play this song <a href="http://www.themountaingoats.net/mountain_goats/cuts_the_strings.txt">here</a> 
</h3>

the first thing that happened was the river overflowed
the water running through the streets and was sweet and cold
i knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream

and then love pulled out the heavy artillery
kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
i count my blessings, but you can only be expected to count so high
when love cuts the strings

i smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
you poked your head out of an alley half a block away
and i recognized you, though i'm not sure how
and the air turned red around you
as a dull chill came down over me

and then love summoned up the infantry
and the green-eyed goddess got ready for all out war
and i'd count my blessings,
but i don't even know what the word blessing means
when love cuts the strings
yeah!

<h3>
<a name="honey">
pure honey</a>
</h3>
i had a thousand good questions
i was gonna ask you when you finally came by
but now that you're really here
there's only one question that comes to my mind.

and that question being:
what's with all the portuguese water dogs?
i'd like to repeat the question.
what's with all the portuguese water dogs?
