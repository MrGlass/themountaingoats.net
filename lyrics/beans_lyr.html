<a name="hendrix">
<h3>the last day of jimi hendrix's life</h3>
</a>
on the last of his life, jimi hendrix woke up
and made his way down the hall
and he adjusted the knobs on the shower till the water came out just the 
way he liked it
it was hot but not too hot
it was hot but not too hot

on the last afternoon of his life, jimi hendrix went to the kitchen
and got himself a glass of water
he put four ice cubes into the glass
there is nothing like cold water
there is nothing

<h4>thanks go out to <i>andrew lison</i> for transcribing this...</h4>


<h3><a name="lemon">Lemon</a></h3>
If you cut a lemon in half
You'll have two distinct pieces
Each one representing
One half of a lemon
Yet now,
Its not so much of a lemon
As it is two distinct pieces
Of that lemon
Licking the lemon juice off the knife
Is <a href="http://www.themountaingoats.net/dang.mp3">dang</a>erous
Imagine cutting the corner of your mouth
And then lemon juice
Ouch
But you already know that the knife
had little, if anything, to do
With creating two distinct pieces
Of that lemon
Sure, the rind and the pulp
Were split by serrated metal
(The wooden handle a little loose from when dad
did the funny thing with his teeth)

<h4>much thanks to <i>mark givens</i> for these lyrics.</h4>
