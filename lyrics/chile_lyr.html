<h3><a name="mules">
night of the mules</a>
</h3>
the street lights gave off an yellow glow
on the holly and the mistletoe
you could feel the rain, coming down.
and quiet starlight, hardened the ground.
till the street shone like a diamond

look sister, here comes a new genuine disaster.
clip-clop up the street,
see the rain, feel the sleet, yeah.

the cold air, unpredictable weather,
ten or twenty of us, huddled together,
hearing the braying, growing louder
snowflakes falling fine white powder.

here come, the new kings
the hooves clack and the metal sings
clip-clop up the street 
see the rain, feel the sleet, yeah.

<h3>
<a name="malibu">
going to malibu</a>
</h3>
when we meet on neutral ground,
i can't belive how good you look.
and the thoughts that race around my mind,
fill a long unreadable book and

i can feel the waves,
i can sense the continents eroding,
you say you know why i called you here,
but you couldn't have any way of knowing, so
that's not true.
that's a mean thing to say.
that's a damnable lie.
that's a damnable lie.

looking at you, and i don't know
what it is i see
and i know you're changing, almost indetectably.

and i see a ship off the shore
and i imagine it sinking.
and you smile and you say that you know
what it is that i'm thinking.
that's not true.
that's a rotten thing to say.
that's a damnable lie.
that's a damnable lie.

<h3>
<a name="billy">
billy the kid's dream of the magic shoes</a>
</h3>
hang me out to dry.
they're gonna hang me out to dry.
i don't really care.
i don't really care.
i got special shoes.
i got special shoes.

they're gonna fill me full of holes.
they're gonna fill me full of holes.
i don't give a rat's ass.
i don't give a rat's ass you rat bastards.
i got special shoes on.
i got special shoes on.
yeah.


<h3>
<a name="berries">
fresh berries for you</a>
</h3>
the world's overrun with new shades of green,
and the dandelions come up like recurring dreams
and the swallows give up their fragile little songs
in the new world

and i know you're only watching out for yourself,
and i know i'm not to take it real personal-like
and i know you only want what's best for everybody.
i know you only want what's best for everybody.

but you better be nice, or the easter bunny's
gonna strike your name out of the
little red book with the silver hinges on it
that he carries.

they've implemented a new system on the
exhaust lines of the buses
and now the air is fresh and sweet and clean when they pass by.
and the bright sun shines down on our fair city,
and young cats play on people's front lawns.

and the time is coming.
and the time is coming.
and i can feel the time coming.
and i know that you can feel the time coming, yourself.

and the easter bunny's coming,
and god knows i'd hate for you to miss it.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.
and it's gonna be so nice.
when the easter bunny comes.

<h3>
<a name="alphabetizing">
alphabetizing</a>
</h3>
the summer crawled by indetectably.
and then i saw you looking down to me.
and your earrings sparkled in the noon-day sun,
and though it's very true that i love everyone,
with every ounce of energy left in me,
i love you especially because

i saw you, coming through
the screen door on the second floor,
up on the balcony.

it was hard to even see you at all,
because the air was thick with alcohol
so i kept on rubbing my eyes,
for all the good it did me,
for all the immeasurable good it did me,
let the years come and take away my memory,
i will not forget the shock that ran through me when,

i saw you, coming through
the screen door on the second floor,
up on the balcony.
