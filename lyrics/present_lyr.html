<h3><a name="rain">
the rain song</a>
</h3>
[john spoken]
...the mountain goats on the umm
well, the um twenty fouth of january - a monday, at about ten
and this is called uh, this is called,
well i don't know what it's called
by the time i write it down, the title is on the tape
and then i'll know what it's called

the rain came down
soaked the old habachi
and i wish i could sing, like allen callaci
and then you would know
how sad it was, when the rain came down

drop by drop
gallon by gallon
brother if i could sing,
if i could sing like allen
you would know
and understand how sad it was when the rain came down
