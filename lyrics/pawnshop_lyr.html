lyrics file for abridged perversion / pawnshop reverb
<pre>
<h3><a name="window">
the window song</a>
</h3>
a knocking sound it woke me up,
but my legs were feeling weak.
i stared up at the ceiling and i saw you at the window.
but my mouth wouldn't let me speak.

chorus:
i know you.
you're the one i spent three seasons trying to pretend
that i never knew.

something pulled me off the bed.
and the same thing moved the muscles in my legs.
i moved towards you voice, and my body got so light,
i could've walked on eggs right then and not broken a one of them.

(chorus)x4
