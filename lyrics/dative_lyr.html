<h3><a name="peace"> 
orange ball of peace 
</a></h3> 

they wanted me to be a lawyer. 
they wanted me to work in a machine shop. 
they wanted me to be a designer, 
but I came out on top. 
I'm a fire-man. 
I'm a fire-man. 

stand and watch the smoke. 
see the flames rise to the sky. 
I stand and watch the flames climb higher. 
I feel the smoke get in my eyes. 
I'm a fire-man. 
I'm a fire-man. 

<h3><a name="bitter8"> 
standard bitter love song #8 
</a></h3> 

I went down to lloyd center looking for you. 
but a mouth full of anger blocked my view. 
he took your hand there in the skating the rink. 
god will give him blood to drink. 

saw the two of you leaving. 
I didn't want to follow behind. 
but I could see the rest of your evening, 
burning in my mind. 

the sky's black. the moon's pink. 
god will give him blood to drink. 

I looked over the railing. ice was white 
on the northeast side where I saw you and your boyfriend 
on a friday night. 
I went mining for gold. I struck pure, fresh zinc. 
god, god will give him blood to drink. 

hey, hey, hey. 


<h3><a name="chino1979"> 
chino love song 1979 
</a></h3> 

and the may sun shone down on california. 
and the strawberries grew fat and full 
and thick and red and as big as your fist 
and the traffic on riverside drive was thin 
but by no means non-existant. 

when I saw you against the soda machine. 
I saw you leaning there. 

and your hand in the basket 
was nimble-fingered, and red finger-nailed 
and it made me remember the sunflower that popped-up outside my window one 
morning in norwalk 
it was bright yellow and it was real inviting 
and I almost forgot that it was an intruder 

and I saw you against the soda machine. 
I saw you leaning there. 

I saw you against the soda machine. 
I saw you leaning there. 


<h3><a name="wrong"> 
wrong! 
</a></h3> 

you know. you know. 
you see what's going on with me. 
but you don't do anything. 
you don't do anything. 
you don't do anything. 

you feel. you feel. 
and you hear. 
the time's near. 
but you don't do anything. 
you don't do anything. 
you don't do anything. 
you don't do anything. 

2, 3, 4. 


<h3><a name="jamaica"> 
going to jamaica 
</a></h3> 

I saw the last of the brightly colored birds 
check out of maine for the other world. 
and you ask me how much longer we have to stay here. 
but I'm not at liberty to say. 

and what flowers there were around kingston are blue. 
I ripped them up from the dry soil and draped them over you. 

we saw the last of the bright colored birds coming home. 
I saw you address them through your megaphone. 
and you asked me when we were leaving. 
well, it's any day now. 

and what flowers there were around trenchtown were red. 
I stole them from the hands of children. 
I braided them around your head. 


<h3><a name="gelida"> 
alpha gelida 
</a></h3> 

popcorn was snapping in the hot oil on the kitchen stove 
and the sky through the kitchen window was cold and poised and threatening. 
heard your voice come lilting through the wall. 
I heard your voice come sailing from the other room. 

let the young lions come. 
let me break their jaws. 
let the young lions come out. 
let me break their jaws with my bare fingers. 

coffee was dripping through the paper filter cone. 
the hip scent of it nearly knocked me out. 
I heard your voice come lilting through the back of the refrigerator. 
I heard your voice come breaking through the wall. 

let the young lions come out. 
let me talk them out of it. 
let the young lions come. 
let me break their jaws with my bare fingers.
