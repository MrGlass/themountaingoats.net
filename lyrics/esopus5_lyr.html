<h3><a name="porcile">porcile</a></h3>
when I wake up I crawl on all fours to the kitchen.
and I admire myself in the dish of water on the floor.
these summer mornings, they can't last forever, you know.
there's gonna come a day, come a day, when no one here can stand it anymore.

the stench and the overwhelming noise.
pull the truck up to the front. drive 'em in boys. drive 'em in boys. drive 'em in.

so when I hear them coming I try to stand up but I fall down.
I fall down and I smash my nose against the counter as I go.
blood splashes on the tiles.
and I wanna clean it up but there isn't time to clean it up is there?
things are bad for us right now.  
things are gonna be bad for awhile.

yeah the stench and the overwhelming noise.
pull the truck up to the door. drive 'em in boys. drive 'em in boys. drive 'em in.
