<h3><a name="blood">
blood royal</a>
</h3>
i remembered you.
i remembered where you'd come from.
i remembered you.
i remembered where you've gone.

in the shifting neon air,
saw the colors of the revolution everywhere
blood royal.

i remembered you.
i remembered all the things you said.
i remembered the shape of your face.
i let the thought go to my head.

in the iron blue dawn,
i felt power coming on.
blood royal.

<h3>
<a name="onlything">
the only thing i know</a>
</h3>
when you came back from trenton,
all the sparkle was gone.
and you stood in the shadow
and the curtains were drawn

and i know you're lying.
and you know you're lying too.
that is just about the only thing i know about you.

when you pocketed your eyeshadow
and you picked up the phone,
stepped out on the balcony
and drank in the drone.

and i know you're leaving.
and you know you're leaving too.
that is just about the only thing i know about you.

when you stop on the sidewalk
and you looked up above you,
warm wet air came down to shelter me.
how much do i love you?

well you know you're dying.
and i know you're dying too.
that is just about the only thing i know about you.

<h3>
<a name="raja">
raja vocative</a>
</h3>
a bird you would've liked brought the sky down,
but it was useless to see it without you around.
and in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye,
i saw you and some foreign guy.

and i could hear you voice ringing.
and i could hear you singing.
from all the way across the country in palm springs,
i can hear you now.


your laughter tore through the new jersey night,
and i can't stand it, but i'm alright.
stood out on the balcony and i took a look around
and a bird you would've loved the sight of
brought the sky down.

and i can hear you voice ringing.
and i can hear you singing.
from all the way across the country in palm springs,
i can hear you now.

<h3>
<a name="hatha">
hatha hill</a>
</h3>
as the sun went away,
you were sending out signals.
you had sugar on you stomach
you had sugar on your hair.
you had sugar underneath you eyes.
you had sugar on your mouth.
i know that trick too.
i know what i means, coming from you.
