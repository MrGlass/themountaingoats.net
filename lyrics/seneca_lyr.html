seneca twins lyrics

<a name="wedding"><h3>
wedding in cherokee county
</h3></a>
there she is 
sittin' there
out behind the smokehouse in her rockin' chair
she don't say nothin'
she don't see nothin'
she don't feel nothin'
she don't know nothin'
maybe she's crazy i don't know.
but maybe that's why i love her so.

her papa was a midget.
her mamma was a whore.
her grandad was a newsboy 'til he was 84, what a slimy old bastard he was.
man don't you think i know that she hates me?
man don't you think i know that she's no good?
man don't you think i know she's crazy?
i think she'd kill me if she could.
maybe she's crazy i don't know
but maybe that's why i love her so

i'm not afraid of the grey wolf
who stalks through our forest at dawn
as long as i have her beside me,
i have the strength to carry on

today we will be married
and all the freaks that she knows will be there
and all the people that i know will be there 
to congratulate us
i will carry her across the threshold.
i will make dim the light
i will attempt to spend my love within her
but though i try with all my might

she will laugh at my mighty sword
she will laugh at my mighty sword
why must everyone laugh at my mighty sword?
lord, help me if you will

maybe we're both crazy, i don't know.
but maybe that's why i love her so.



<a name="heart"><h3>
heart would surely grieve
</h3></a>
cut out the lightbulb
put gunpowder in the light
and then i screw the lightbulb back into the socket
and then i turn on the light.
it will blow this place from here to hell.
it will blow this place from here to hell.

if i open up the front door
and then i open up the back door
and then i open up the windows all the way
it may cool down in here.
i could use a little cool air.
i could use a little cool air.

if i said what i'd been meaning to say
if my headache ever goes away
it'll surely cost me dearly.
it'll surely cost me dearly.
it'll surely cost me dearly.



<a name="floating"><h3>
the floating gardens
</h3></a>
i came clean down to mexico for you.
what else would you have me do?
the bills were stacking up daily,
there were predators at my door.
drooling like hungry jackals,
i made my mind up to track you down.
you were standing above the tall tall reeds
chewing on pumpkin seeds.
you've got you money invested in gold futures now
and you're waiting for me to come,
well, i'm coming.

you left a mountain of bad debt behind you.
yeah, back in california where the cops came to find you
but when they came, they found me instead
pacing the floors wondering whether you were dead
and half way hoping, hoping half the other way
and now you're standing among the tall tall reeds
lit up like a christmas tree,
you've got your money invested in gold futures now
and you're waiting for the rain to come,
well, i'm coming.



<a name="goodbye"><h3>
goodbye white chapel
</h3></a>
i came into the harbor at boston
young and wild and free
and i made my way down the countryside.
what's become of me?
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia opened up her arms.
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia opened her arms up wide.

the corn was tall
the corn was tall
the corn was tall.
the wind was hard
the wind was hard
the wind was hard.
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia opened up her arms.
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia opened her arms up wide.

when i was creeping
when i was creeping
when i was creeping
robert e. lee broke his musket on his knee
and a thousand pieces shattered on the ground
but he got up quick
he gathered up his men
and from his lips there came an awful sound.
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia opened up her arms.
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia
savannah, georgia opened her arms up wide.

xolo

looks like rain passed by again this year.
looks like the sky as far as the naked eye can see is completely clear.
the hairless chihuahua who found this place yesterday
didn't even stick around anyway.

looks like you're gone for good.
looks like the steps leading up to the front porch are stained with blood.
we stared up into the mexican sky
as though we were searching for gold.
and it's vast and it's cruel and cold.

shame shame shame shame on you.
shame shame shame shame on you.
shame shame shame shame on you.
shame shame shame shame on you.


<a name="harvest"><h3>
harvest song
</h3></a>
when you left on a saturday night
the money'd run out and the stars were bright
and you made your way down the hall and i pulled down the shades
and i felt the heat rise again
felt the pressure behind my eyes again
and we fell smack dab in the middle of the everglades
and the dogs howling your name 
there was murder in your voice
here comes the harvest
here comes the harvest 
here it comes


when your letter came on a tuesday afternoon
six months later near the end of june
?????? blood
and i felt my concentration slip
so i bit down on my lower lip
and as the cicadas started singing again, i tasted blood.
and the dogs howling again
there is murder in your voice
here comes the harvest
here comes the harvest 
here it comes


<a name="rise"><h3>
rise above it
</h3></a>
<h6>this song is on "Around the Horn" by Souled American, and was probably written a long time ago by A.P. Carter</h6>
My sweetheart's gone and left me
And my little sister, too
and I'm left alone in sadness
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do

I don't want your greenback dollar
Don't want your watch and chain
All I want is you, my darling
Won't you take me back?
Rise above it, rise above it.





<a name="rebel"><h3>
rebel girl
</h3></a>
<h6>this is a bikini kill song</h6>
that girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood
she's got the hottest trike in town
that girl she holds her head up so high
i think i wanna be her best friend

rebel girl rebel girl
rebel girl you are the queen of my world
rebel girl rebel girl 
i think i wanna take you home
i wanna try on your clothes, girl

when she walks, the revolution's coming
in her hips, there's revolution
when she talks, i hear the revolution
in her kiss, we kiss the revolution
rebel girl rebel girl
rebel girl you are the queen of my world
rebel girl rebel girl 
i know i wanna take you home
i wanna try on your clothes, girl

that girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood
i got news for you
she is
they say she's a slut but I know
she is my best friend
rebel girl rebel girl
rebel girl you are the queen of my world
rebel girl rebel girl 
i know i wanna take you home
i wanna try on your clothes, girl

i really like you, i really love you
i really wanna be your best friend
love you like a sister always
soul sister blood sister
please be my rebel girl
