lyrics file for the long secret
<pre>
<h3><a name="duke">
duke ellington</a>
</h3>
the light hit the rings
glimmering on his fingers
the light came down
and his hands hit the keys
it utterly wasted me in sweden
the horns punched the air
the aftermath fell around everywhere
i saw the spotlight land on his rings
and i'd had just about enough losing things
in sweden in nineteen sixty-two
quite some distance from you

<h3><a name="process">
process of elimination</a>
</h3>
in sicily, it's awfully hot
and where we were most decidedly not
so i looked around
i saw heaven coming down
around you

in washington, it's cold as ice
and we were warm in the arms of christ himself
i took a long look at you face
i saw the angel take his place
beside you

there's monsoons
in kashmir
i was worried that you'd dissapear
i touched your arm just to be on the safe side
and the world broke apart and fell off by the wayside
next to you
