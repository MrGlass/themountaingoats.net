<h3><a name="adair">adair</a></h3>
i got my eye on the scar
it runs clear from your temple to your jawline
you'll tell me about all your thoughts right this minute
then I will tell you mine.

'cause i got the wind in my hair
and I'm far away from where i used to be
but i got all my attention fixed on you
and you're flashing that smile at me.

with the midwestern sky burning above us
we lean up against the car
i want to tell you what the sky has done to me
i want you to tell me who we are
'cause i see you raising the water to your lips
it's the blazing dead center of july
and i got all my hopes hung on one gorgeous promise
and you got the sunlight dancing on your eyes

and i got the wind in my hair
and i'm far away from where i used to be
but i got all my attention fixed on you
and you're just where you said you'd be
just where you said you'd be



<h3><a name="entebbe">raid on entebbe</a></h3>
on the shores of a lake named after a late queen of england
i heard new rumors of war.
the sun was a red ball up in the summer sky.
i saw my sister standing in the doorway.
she had that look on her face that reminded me of you.
the reports were coming hourly and the sky was blue.
they were shifting the power again.
they always do this when i come home.

i tucked my shirt in, though i don't know why.
shielded my eyes from the light up in the sky
'cause it was shining, blazing, like a highway flare
in the incredibly impossibly dry air
i heard my mother call my sister to the kitchen again
and thought that everything was headed straight down the drain
they positioned themselves in strategic locations
i was beginning to lose my patience.
if you'll just put your hand in mine,
we're gonna leave all our troubles behind.



<h3><a name="salonae">an inscription at salonae</a></h3>
there was guy up on the hill,
with a trumpet to his lips,
i mean to tell you he knew how to blow that thing.

there were women dressed in purple,
banging on their tamborines,
and hammering on cymbals (symbols?).

it was not that long ago
when we gathered in the valley below
i loved you more than i loved my own life
i was falling to pieces.

there was a young man on the altar
you saw me poised above him
i saw you watching me.

there were singers, there were dancers
there was glittering gold
spring breaking out gradually.

it was not that long ago
but the memory's kinda dying out 'cha know
like a flower caught in the overgrowth,
falling, falling to pieces.



<h3> <a name="ireland">there will always be an ireland</a></h3>
cold northern wind
your young arm
against my face
soft and warm

there will always be an ireland.
there will always be an ireland.

silent hour
worthless words
view of some foreign city from the high window
strange black birds

there will always be an ireland.
there will always be an ireland.

what we did
the things we said
your hand resting
on my head

there will always be an ireland.
there will always be an ireland.
there will always be an ireland.
there will always be an ireland.
